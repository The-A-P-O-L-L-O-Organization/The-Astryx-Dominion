## Site Philosophy & Placement
- **Location:** Suspended platforms within lagoon perimeter, outside immediate ritual radius of the Tree of Spirits (Metkayina variant) and tidal ceremonial pathways. Structures float or rest on non-invasive pilings avoiding reef contact.
- **Design Ethos:** “Tide & Coral Integration” — architecture follows marine contours and current flows; visual and acoustic minimization to preserve marine life rhythms.
- **Cultural Protocol:** Full consultation with Metkayina elders established prior to siting; ceremonial notification and blessing performed with Na’vi partners. No base element placed in direct line-of-sight or tidal path of sacred sites.

## Architectural Overview & Layout

### A. Central Command & Tide Atrium (CCTA)
- **Function:** Operational heart — marine telemetry, GAIA-linked projection, coordination of aerial/aquatic units.
- **Design:** Semi-submerged hemispherical atrium with adjustable buoyancy; exterior clad in bio-compatible composites resembling kelp fronds.
- **Features:** Live holographic reef maps, tidal corridor projection, flux-anchor array, and ritual observation alcove for Metkayina elders (non-invasive, acoustically transparent).

### B. Reef Rehabilitation & Bioreactor Complex (RRBC)
- **Function:** On-site coral nurseries, microbial detox bioreactors, algae farms for bioremediation.
- **Design:** Shallow floating trays segregated by salinity gradients; automated soft-robot tenders for non-destructive planting.
- **Integration:** Co-curated with Metkayina reef-keepers; seed banks for reef genotypes under dual-key co-stewardship.

### C. Marine Research Wing (MRW)
- **Function:** Wet labs, submersible hangars, acoustic ecology suites, and controlled aquarium for behavioral study.
- **Design:** Pressurized, isolated labs with pass-through decontamination tunnels; direct submersible launch bays that avoid reef trampling.
- **Protocols:** Strict non-transfer rules for live specimens; all exports require Metkayina consent + GC audit.

### D. Liaison Embankment & Ceremonial Pavilion
- **Function:** Cultural exchange, ritual participation, education, and legal councils.
- **Design:** Open-air, timber-and-fiber pavilions elevated on stilts; acoustically optimized for songlines and tidal chant.
- **Usage:** Hosts seasonal rites, joint teaching, and dispute mediation; maintains a private area reserved for clan-only ceremonies.

### E. Dock & Amphibious Access Nodes (DAAN)
- **Function:** Landing bays for amphibious craft, Skyfang co-piloted water landings, drone staging, and supply.
- **Design:** Floating docks with soft-mooring to prevent reef abrasion; tidal-adaptive ramps for low-impact offload.
- **Safety:** No overflight of sacred tidal corridors; flight corridors mapped with Metkayina navigators.

### F. Submersible Observation Corridors (SOC)
- **Function:** Enclosed underwater viewing tunnels for cultural education and passive monitoring.
- **Design:** Transparent, reinforced composite tubes with controlled light to prevent bioluminescent disturbance.
- **Access:** Public viewing scheduled during low-impact windows under Metkayina oversight.

## Power, Propulsion & Communications
- **Power:** Hybrid microgrid combining:
    - Primary: small quantum-seeded superconductive cell (limited Q-ore reserves, strictly regulated).
    - Secondary: tidal-energy harvesters integrated into lagoon currents.
    - Tertiary: bio-solar mats (bioluminescent energy capture) tuned to local flora cycles.
- **Propulsion & Logistics:** amphibious cargo frames, buoyant cargo gliders, Skyfang water-landing protocols (co-created with Metkayina pilots).
- **Communications:**
    - Local: flux-locked mesh beacons & acoustical low-latency channels for sub-surface comms.
    - Backhaul: quantum-encrypted uplink to ORCCN & GAIA.
    - Cultural Channel: dedicated ritual-frequency link for ceremonial coordination and songline broadcast (read-only archive access unless invited).

## Personnel & Roles
- **Regional Director (Prime clearance)** — overall command, liaison with Na’vi councils.
- **Metkayina Liaison Officer (dual-authority)** — Metkayina-appointed representative living on-site; chairs cultural sessions.
- **Marine Biologists & Ecologists** — reef & microbial restoration leads.
- **Submersible & UAV Pilots** — amphibious transport and observation.
- **Cultural Stewards & Aeonborn Liaisons** — ensure consent protocols and cultural integrity.
- **Security & Flux Engineers** — non-lethal perimeter, flux anchors, and environmental shields.

## Operations & Protocols
### Environmental & Cultural Safeguards
- **Sacred Radius Enforcement:** automatic exclusion zones (soft barriers) around Tree of Spirits tidal zone; any approach requires liaison authorization and ceremonial notification.
- **Ritual Calendar Respect:** base schedules adjust to Metkayina seasonal rites; non-essential operations paused during sacred observances.
- **Acoustic & Light Controls:** all exterior lighting and acoustic emissions limited to spectra and decibel levels pre-approved by Metkayina elders.

### Research & Sample Governance
- **Dual-Key Stewardship:** all biological samples and cultural data stored under dual-key control (Metkayina elder + UL director).
- **No-Transfer Clause:** exports off-Pandora strictly prohibited unless joint-approved with GC audit.
- **Consented Trial Framework:** any experimental trials (e.g., aquatic Ophion variants) require explicit Metkayina consent, documented ritual agreement, and Ethics Dept. sign-off.

### Patrol & Monitoring
- **Skyfang & Amphibious Patrols:** pre-mapped corridors minimize ecological impact; pilots briefed on tidal behavior and clan movements.
- **GAIA Integration:** base feeds continuous ecosystem metrics to GAIA for early-warning and impact assessment; Eywa-resonance monitoring active.

---

## Biosecurity & Quarantine
- **Multi-Stage Decon:** personnel and equipment undergo staged quarantine before leaving lagoon zones; sample containment enforced.
- **Containment Labs:** rapid-response biocontainment for accidental exposures, with emergency rollback protocols (Override Spear authority limited, logged).
- **No-Export for Live Biota:** default policy forbids live organisms leaving without explicit dual-key authorization.

---

## Cultural Integration & Programs
- **Apprenticeship & Employment:** priority hiring and training for Metkayina youth in reef restoration, submersible piloting, and data stewardship.
- **Shared Education Center:** bilingual academy teaching both Na’vi oral-tech traditions and UL restoration science.
- **Ceremonial Access:** facilities and resources for clan rituals, including transport for elders and ritual supplies storage.

---

## Emergency & Contingency Plans
- **Evacuation Protocols:** amphibious + Skyfang extraction with safe corridors; ceremonial notifications integrated into evacuation signals.
- **Contamination Response:** RRBC transfusion lines ready for immediate uptake; triage & tri-modal neutralization (biological, chemical, thermal).
- **Environmental Reversion:** decommission plan includes dismantling floating infrastructure, re-wilding attachments, and seed-banking.

## Ethical & Legal Notes (must be included in every mission packet)
- **Non-Extraction Covenant:** MRCMI operations strictly non-extractive regarding Q-ore/unobtanium; any limited Q-ore use is from pre-approved UL reserves.
- **Transparency & Audit:** all activities logged to Genesis Vault; GC auditors granted scheduled access.
- **Indigenous Rights:** Metkayina co-stewardship rights legally enforceable; any breach triggers immediate GC review and remediation orders.

## Closing Operational Intent
MRCMI is conceived as a **living, reversible, and cooperative** base that honors Metkayina sovereignty and the lagoon’s ecological rhythms. It is designed to be a partner — not an occupier — ensuring that restoration, research, and cultural exchange proceed hand-in-hand under GC oversight and UL stewardship.
