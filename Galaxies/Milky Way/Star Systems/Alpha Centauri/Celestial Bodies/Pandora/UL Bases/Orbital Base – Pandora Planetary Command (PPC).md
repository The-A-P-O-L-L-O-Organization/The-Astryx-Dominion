**Location:** Geostationary orbit above Pandora’s equator, aligned over the Hallelujah Mountains to maintain direct relay with the densest cluster of ground bases.  
**Primary Function:** System-wide command and control, orbital logistics, research hub, and GC enforcement relay.  
**Base Code:** PAN-PPC / Genesis Vault Tag: UL-PANDORA-COMMAND  
**Clearance:** Founder / Omef-Council Only

## Purpose & Role
- **Central Command Node:** Oversees all ground operations (Ometicaya, Metkayina, Mangkwan, Aranahe, Kame’tire, Zeswa bases, etc.).
- **GC Law Enforcement:** Serves as the Galactic Council’s “judicial eye,” ensuring UL compliance and enforcement of stewardship law across Pandora.
- **Orbital Logistics Hub:** Manages traffic of Skyfang transports, cargo haulers, and research satellites.
- **Defense & Containment:** Provides planetary-scale protective systems if hostile incursions or ecological disasters occur.
- **Research Relay:** Aggregates all biological, cultural, and environmental data collected by ground bases into the Genesis Vault and Aeonframe archives.
- **Advanced Research Hub:** Runs experiments unsafe or disruptive for Pandora’s surface — genetic editing, extreme-environment simulations, deep-space hybridization tests.
- **Pandora-Eywa Interface Study:** Models the Eywa-linked neural web in contained systems; attempts partial AI-symbiont bridging.
- **Zero-G Physiology & Hybridization:** Monitors how Na’vi, humans, and hybrids adapt biologically to orbital and deep-space conditions.
- **Planetary Defense & Contingency:** Serves as both shield and final fallback in case of ecosystemic catastrophe.

## Architecture & Layout
### 1. **Command Spire**
- Core operations tower with panoramic holotables showing real-time Pandora ecosystems.
- GAIA’s orbital processing node embedded within, linked to System for instantaneous oversight.
- Founder’s Observation Deck — transparent dome with direct planetary view.

### 2. **Docking Ring**
- Multiple docking arms for Skyfang carriers, supply ships, and science vessels.
- Automated hangar cranes and drones handle resupply and refit.
- Shielded quarantine bays for biological or xenotech samples.

### 3. **Research & Data Vaults**
- Quantum-linked Genesis Vault satellite cluster stores all UL research.
- Biocontainment labs for samples too hazardous for ground storage.
- Eywa Interface Research Wing: studying safe ways to interact with and model Eywa’s planetary neural web.

### 4. **Defense Array**
- Obscura-compatible cloaking veil hides station from deep-space detection.
- Orbital shield projectors capable of covering vulnerable ground bases.
- Kinetic interceptors and drone swarms for spaceborne threats.

### 5. **Crew Habitat & Cultural Center**
- Modular rotating ring for gravity.
- Quarters for UL staff, GC envoys, and Na’vi dignitaries invited to orbit.
- Arboretum blending Pandora flora with offworld species — symbol of restoration and unity.

### 6. **Ethics & Oversight Council Chambers**
- Permanent chambers for UL-Board representatives and GC observers.
- Transparent court process for planetary-scale decisions (with Founder oversight).

### 7. **Xenobiology Wing**
- Orbital terraria replicating Pandora biomes (floating isopods, bioluminescent fungi, carnivorous flora).
- Controlled Na’vi symbiosis simulations (safe Eywa-link testbeds).
- Hybrid trials in low-gravity — testing Ecliptic, Gemini, Pantheon genome extensions under orbital strain.

### 8. **Genetic & Neural Labs**
- **Neural Mesh Studio:** Simulates Na’vi tsaheylu (neural bond) with Eywa; allows UL to build safe “mirror-links” for humans/hybrids.
- **Pantheon Genome Array:** Runs cross-species adaptive coding experiments (e.g., aquatic → arboreal genome shifts).
- **Biostasis Chambers:** Long-term stasis/hibernation trials for both Na’vi volunteers and hybrid units.

### 9. **Exo-Biome Cylinder**
- Rotating lab habitat where entire Pandora micro-ecosystems are housed in artificial gravity.
- Used to study closed-loop biosphere dynamics outside of Eywa’s direct influence.
- Can simulate extreme GC-world conditions (acidic atmospheres, super-heavy gravity).

### 10. **Symbiont Containment Vaults**
- Secure modules for dangerous experiments (serpentiform hybrids, aggressive flora grafts).
- Triple-sealed, with full emergency purge-to-sun protocol.
- Monitored by AI/human joint oversight.

## Systems & Protocols
- **All-Bases Synchronization:** Instant uplink/downlink with every Pandora ground base.
- **Eywa-Respect Mandates:** Protocol triggers reviewed by Na’vi representatives before use in planetary environments.
- **Protocol Override Chamber:** Secure vault for emergency activations of biological protocols (Morrow, Gemini, Ecliptic, etc.) at planetary scale.
- **Fail-Safe Genesis Lock:** If station is compromised, Genesis Vault automatically severs itself and retreats into deep orbit.

## Symbol
- Center orb (Pandora) surrounded by **two rotating halos** (command and science).
- A vertical helix rising into orbit, with branching filaments — representing genetic ascension.
