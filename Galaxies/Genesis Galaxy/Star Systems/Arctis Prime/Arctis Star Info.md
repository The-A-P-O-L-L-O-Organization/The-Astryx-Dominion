**Star Name:** Arctis  
**Star Type:** Yellow Dwarf (G2V)  
**Age:** ~4.6 billion years  
**Luminosity:** 1.05 L☉  
**Spectral Characteristics:** Stable solar output with occasional minor flare activity. Strong magnetic fields influence planetary magnetospheres, but negligible risk to orbital stations with standard shielding.  
**Special Notes:**

- Arctis exhibits weak solar winds enriched in rare isotopes, useful for UL energy experiments.
    
- The star emits faint UV pulses detectable in deep-space sensor networks, utilized for calibrating UL long-range communications.
