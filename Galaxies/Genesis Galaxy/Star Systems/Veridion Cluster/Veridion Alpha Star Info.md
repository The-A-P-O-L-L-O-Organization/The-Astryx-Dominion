## **Notable Features for Narrative Integration**

1. **Visible Characteristics:** A bright yellow sun from planetary surface; occasional solar flares create spectacular aurora effects in polar regions
    
2. **Observational Relevance:** Stellar activity logs can provide in-game hooks for monitoring rogue AI, energy anomalies, or spire malfunctions
    
3. **Lore Hooks:** The star is sometimes referenced as the **“Anchor of Eidolon”** due to its central role in sustaining the Minerva Spire network
    
4. **Threat Mitigation:** Stellar radiation can interfere with unshielded experimental drones or rogue systems, providing natural hazards for missions

## **Potential Player Interactions**

- **Energy Research Missions:** Players may calibrate spire energy collectors or repair solar harvester nodes
    
- **Environmental Anomaly Response:** Track flare events to prevent disruptions to experimental populations on Eidolon Prime
    
- **AI Integration:** MINERVA subfunction may analyze stellar patterns to predict galactic-level threats or optimize spire defenses
