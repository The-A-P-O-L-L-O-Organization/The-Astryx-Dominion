## **Environmental and Strategic Features**

- **Oceanic Zones:** Support aquatic experimental modules and bio-simulation habitats
    
- **Continental Zones:** Host UL spires, including Minerva Spire, and hybridization or AI observation facilities
    
- **Volcanic Archipelagos:** Serve as natural isolation zones for high-risk experiments
    
- **Climate:** Temperate overall, stable weather patterns due to orbital regularity; microclimates managed via spire-controlled environmental modulators
