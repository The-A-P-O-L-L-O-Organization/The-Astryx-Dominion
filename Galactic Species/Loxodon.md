## **Overview**

Loxodons are elephantine humanoids characterized by thick skin, tusks, elongated trunks, and massive, muscular frames. They combine physical power with high intelligence, strategic thinking, and a strong social memory.

- **Height:** 2.4–3.0 meters
    
- **Build:** Massive, muscular, and imposing
    
- **Key Traits:** Trunks for manipulation, tusks for defense, high endurance
    

**Physiological Traits:**

- Dense musculature and thick hide allow for extreme durability in harsh environments
    
- Trunks serve multiple purposes: dexterity, communication, and tool handling
    
- Tusks can be used for combat, construction, or ceremonial displays
    
- Exceptional memory and cognitive pattern recognition support leadership and coordination roles

## **Homeworld: Gravitas Prime**

- **Type:** Rocky planet with expansive plains, plateaus, and mountainous regions
    
- **Gravity:** 1.2g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Oxygen-nitrogen mix; slightly higher pressure suitable for large-bodied life
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 18–30°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Vast savannahs and grasslands supporting herd migration patterns
        
    - Dense forests with resilient flora adapted to heavy herbivores
        
    - Mountain ranges rich in minerals and geologically active zones
        

**Native Fauna:**

- **Gravitan Behemoths:** Massive quadrupeds used as ecological analogs for Loxodon strength training
    
- **Tusked Grazers:** Herbivores providing insights into herd dynamics and environmental adaptation
    
- **Stoneback Raptors:** Predators emphasizing cooperative defense strategies
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Loxodons thrive in environments with moderate to high gravity, rugged terrain, and expansive spaces. They excel in heavy labor, construction, and coordinated group operations.
