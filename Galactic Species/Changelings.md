## **Species File — Changeling**

**Homeworld:** _None (Artificial Origin — Project: [[GEM]])_  
**Galaxy:** Milky Way  
**Dominant Star-Nation(s):**

- **None officially recognized** — many live disguised among other species
    
- **United Laboratories (historical)** — origin traced to rogue BioTech division (United BioWorks) experiment
    
- **Genesis Defense Charter (classified oversight)** — maintains covert observation protocols

### **Overview**

The **Changelings** are a genetically engineered sapient species created unintentionally through the horrific experimentation of **Project: GEM (Genetic Engineering & Modification)**. Designed by rogue scientists of United Laboratories’ BioTech division (United BioWorks), their purpose was to develop an _adaptive polymorphic genome_ capable of surviving any planetary or biological environment.

They were born not from nature, but from agony — subjects who survived the breakdown and forced reconstruction of their cellular architecture. Their biology was rewritten thousands of times, spliced with alien DNA strands and self-healing nano-bio interfaces until it no longer resembled any known species.

When the project was exposed, the surviving subjects were freed — yet the damage had been done. Their bodies could change form at will, but their identities were fractured. The result: a new, tragic species of **shapeshifters** with perfect mimicry and uncertain souls.

### **Origins — Project: GEM**

**Project Directive:**  
To engineer a “universal genome” capable of cross-species adaptation, regeneration, and environmental survival.

**Key Process Stages:**

- **Reconstruction Chambers:**  
    Subjects were repeatedly dissolved into cellular suspension and rebuilt, each cycle introducing new DNA strands, nanite regulators, and adaptive morphogen triggers. Pain was constant; death was common.
    
- **Forced Symbiosis:**  
    Alien biotech — including parasitic gene-weaves and synthetic organelles — were introduced to stabilize morphic shifts. Some remnants still linger as autonomous organ-clusters within changeling bodies.
    
- **Sensory Overload Protocols:**  
    Subjects were bombarded with stimuli during reconstruction — light, sound, pheromones, even alien neurotransmitters — to destabilize their perception of self, ensuring form could no longer be “locked.”
    
- **Cognitive Reimprinting:**  
    Surviving minds were wiped, rewritten, and reassembled from fragmented neural maps. The result was identity diffusion — memories blending into emotionless instinct.

### **Biology & Physiology**

- **Form:** Amorphous base state — translucent, gelatinous, vaguely humanoid silhouette
    
- **Mass:** Variable, dependent on absorbed biomass (average 70–100 kg)
    
- **Internal Structure:** Adaptive pseudo-organic matrix combining flesh, nanite gel, and living crystal fibers
    
- **Core Traits:**
    
    - **Mimetic Cellular Architecture** — allows replication of external forms down to skin texture, scent, and voice.
        
    - **Neural Plasticity** — capable of learning physical behaviors and mimicking motor skills instantly after brief observation.
        
    - **Biochemical Modulation** — internal fluids can simulate different blood chemistries, allowing infiltration of diverse species.
        
    - **Venom Resistance & Regeneration** — an unintentional byproduct of cell reconstruction cycles.
        
- **Limitations:**
    
    - Extended mimicry strains neural cohesion; maintaining false forms too long risks mental disassociation.
        
    - Genetic instability can result in “form collapse” under stress — reverting to their amorphous, featureless origin state.

### **Culture & Society**

Changelings do not possess a unified culture. They are a **diaspora of survivors**, scattered through the galaxy, each struggling with fractured memories of their pre-abduction lives.

- Many live **under assumed identities**, hiding among other species, fearing discovery or rejection.
    
- A few gather in secret enclaves known as **Reflection Cells**, where they explore the philosophy of form and identity.
    
- They speak of **“The Echo Genome”** — a mythic concept that one day, they might all merge their memories and reconstruct who they once were.
    

Some changelings embrace their condition, becoming master infiltrators, diplomats, or performers. Others descend into identity crises, losing themselves in the endless cycle of imitation.

### **Behavioral Traits**

- **Personality Fluidity:** Their sense of self is mutable; long-term emotional consistency is rare.
    
- **Empathy Through Imitation:** Many experience emotions only after mimicking them from others.
    
- **Survivor Instinct:** Deep-rooted trauma manifests as hypervigilance and adaptive aggression.
    
- **Aversion to Containment:** Even symbolic restriction (like tight clothing or confinement) can trigger panic responses linked to lab trauma.

### **Galactic Integration**

While not an officially recognized species by any major polity, changelings are known to have infiltrated:

- **United Comms** — as identity-shifting operatives or diplomatic translators
    
- **United Defense** — covert agents, spies, and adaptive field infiltrators
    
- **Genesis Defense Charter** — covertly monitored under “GEM Retainment Protocols”
    

Some changelings have been granted asylum within **New Omega Aeternum**, where they undergo therapy and reintegration programs overseen by **United Cognition** and **United BioWorks**.

### **Technological & Genetic Significance**

Changeling DNA remains one of the most studied genetic anomalies in UL archives. The **GEM Genome**, despite its dark origin, revolutionized:

- **Adaptive Nanobiology** — self-healing bio-materials modeled after changeling cellular lattices
    
- **Morphogen Control Interfaces** — used in hybrid biotech design
    
- **Cognitive Reconstruction Frameworks** — leading to neural stabilization therapies for trauma victims
    

However, research into the GEM genome is now heavily restricted under **Genesis Code 44-C**, prohibiting any further sentient experimentation.
