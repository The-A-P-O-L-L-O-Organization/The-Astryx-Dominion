## **Overview**

Veylith are elongated, serpentine humanoids with sinuous bodies, forked tongues, and flexible scales. They lack traditional legs but can coil, slither, and climb with exceptional agility.

**Key Traits:**

- **Forked Tongues:** Chemosensory organs provide environmental data, detect pheromones, and analyze toxins or energy signatures
    
- **Flexible Spine:** Allows rapid coiling, climbing, and high-speed strikes
    
- **Scales:** Provide natural protection against abrasion, moderate impacts, and environmental hazards
    
- **Enhanced Sensory Awareness:** Veylith have exceptional spatial perception, night vision, and motion detection

## **Homeworld: Ssythra**

- **Type:** Rocky-forested planet with dense canopies, labyrinthine cave networks, and winding river systems
    
- **Gravity:** 1.0g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Oxygen-nitrogen mix with trace sulfur compounds; ideal for chemosensory function
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 18–30°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Dense jungles and riverine networks for ambush and navigation training
        
    - Cave systems with bioluminescent fungi and mineral deposits
        
    - High-altitude cliff networks for observation and scouting
        

**Native Fauna:**

- _Serpentaris_ — highly camouflaged ambush predators
    
- _Climber Crusts_ — small, agile creatures adapted to cliffs and treetops
    
- _Glowspores_ — bioluminescent plants and fungi providing environmental cues
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Veylith thrive in vertical and labyrinthine terrains. Their forked tongues allow real-time chemical and environmental analysis, making them excellent trackers and hazard navigators.

## **Cultural Characteristics**

- **Core Ethos:** _“Sense, adapt, strike.”_
    
- Societies are organized around clans that inhabit specific biomes — forest, cave, and cliff clans maintain specialized skills
    
- Ritualized tracking, scent-mapping, and climbing ceremonies are central to social and cultural identity
    
- Architecture integrates verticality and natural features — elevated platforms, cliffside dwellings, and subterranean labs

Veylith

**Creature Type:** Humanoid

**Size:** Medium (4–6 feet long, serpentine body)  
**Speed:** 30 feet, climb 20 feet, swim 20 feet

---

## **Forked Tongue & Chemoperception**

Your forked tongue allows you to detect chemical signatures, pheromones, and toxins in the environment. You gain advantage on Survival checks to track creatures by scent and on Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect poisons, hazards, or environmental anomalies.

---

## **Sibilant Speech**

Veylith communicate with hissing sibilants. When roleplaying, you must enunciate S’s audibly (i.e., sssounds). Failing to do so may cause minor social misunderstandings with other Veylith or species familiar with your culture.

- **Ability Effect:** Allies within 10 feet who understand Veylith gain advantage on Insight checks to gauge your intent.
    
- **Roleplay Note:** This does not mechanically alter combat but enriches social interaction.

## **Senses**

- **Darkvision:** 60 feet
    
- **Enhanced Smell:** You can detect presence of creatures or substances within 30 feet even if they are invisible or obscured by light cover.
    
- **Motion Awareness:** Advantage on Initiative checks and Dexterity saving throws against traps or area hazards.

---

## **Neural Implant (Optional for Campaigns)**

Your UL-issue neural implant allows:

- **Override/Coordination:** For tactical scenarios under UL guidance.
    
- **Live Translation:** Communicate with other UL species using direct neural translation.
