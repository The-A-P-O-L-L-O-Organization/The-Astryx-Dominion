## **Overview**

Plasmoids are amorphous, semi-intelligent lifeforms capable of altering their shape, density, and physical structure at will. They have no fixed limbs, and can form temporary appendages or tools from their body mass.

**Key Traits:**

- **Shape-shifting:** Can form temporary arms, grips, or sensory appendages
    
- **Adaptive Physiology:** Resistant to pressure, radiation, toxins, and temperature extremes
    
- **Neural Plasticity:** High cognitive flexibility; capable of rapid learning and multitasking
    
- **Semi-Translucence:** Allows internal energy flow to be visualized under certain conditions

## **Homeworld: Gelora Prime**

- **Type:** Fluidic-rich planet with semi-liquid surfaces, dense atmospheric ion storms, and floating landmasses
    
- **Gravity:** 0.85g–1.0g (variable regions due to floating landmasses)
    
- **Atmosphere:** Nitrogen-oxygen with high ionic content; conductive and bio-compatible for Plasmoid physiology
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 15–28°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Semi-liquid oceans containing naturally conductive and bioluminescent life
        
    - Floating islands with ionic vegetation
        
    - Subsurface caverns with exotic mineral deposits
        

**Native Fauna:**

- **Ion Serpents:** Energy-conducting serpentine predators
    
- **Geliform Swarms:** Collective Plasmoid-like lifeforms exhibiting hive-mind behaviors
    
- **Shock Crabs:** Semi-solid crustaceans adapted to high ion flux
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Plasmoids naturally thrive in fluidic, conductive, and high-energy environments. Their form-shifting ability allows them to navigate difficult terrain, squeeze through small spaces, and interface directly with environmental energy sources.

## **Cultural Characteristics**

- **Core Ethos:** _“Adapt, flow, and integrate.”_
    
- Societies are fluid, often forming temporary communities based on shared research, exploration, or energy-harvesting projects
    
- Communication is often telepathic or via conductive pulses, with minimal reliance on spoken language
    
- Architecture is minimal; Plasmoids favor energy-conductive frameworks and adaptable laboratory environments
