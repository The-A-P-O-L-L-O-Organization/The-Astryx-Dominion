**Species File — Lizardfolk**

**Homeworld:** _Sszarath_  
**Galaxy:** Andromeda  
**Dominant Star-Nation(s):**

- **United Terraform** — Lizardfolk excel in swamp, jungle, and marshland terraforming, environmental restoration, and hydro-engineering.
    
- **United Defense** — Their amphibious abilities, tails, and natural armor make them effective in border patrols, aquatic operations, and tactical deployment in hostile terrains.
    
- **United BioWorks** — Lizardfolk biology is ideal for experimental bio-adaptations, aquaculture, and hybrid environmental projects.

### **Overview**

Lizardfolk are bipedal reptilian humanoids with prehensile tails, scaly skin, and semi-amphibious physiology. They possess natural strength, enhanced swimming abilities, and adaptive sensory perception for both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Their intelligence is practical and survival-oriented, often displaying strong tactical instincts and communal cooperation.

**Physiological Traits:**

- Height: 1.7–2.1 meters
    
- Weight: 70–120 kg
    
- Tail: Prehensile, used for balance, swimming propulsion, and as a weapon
    
- Skin: Scaled with varying thickness; provides natural armor
    
- Senses: Acute vision in low light, enhanced olfactory and aquatic senses

### **Mutagenic Adaptation Notes**

**Project: Sszarath Vanguard** — UL’s mutagenic enhancement program for Lizardfolk:

- **Safe Dose:** Enhances swimming speed, tail strength, muscle density, and sensory perception
    
- **Overdose:** Produces extreme physical resilience, hyper-accelerated regeneration, heightened amphibious senses, and temporary growth of additional fins or clawed appendages
    
- **Control Integration:** Neural implants ensure behavioral compliance, environmental awareness, and coordination during field operations

### **Modern Integration**

- **Terraforming & Ecology:** Frontline workers in wetland restoration, hydro-engineering, and biodiversity conservation
    
- **Military & Security:** Amphibious patrol units, tactical reconnaissance, and high-mobility rapid-response teams
    
- **Bio-Engineering:** Participants in hybrid species studies, aquaculture research, and ecological adaptation projects
    

---

### **Cultural Interactions**

- Lizardfolk maintain cooperative relations with **Kobolds**, **Dragonborn**, and **Goliaths** for environmental, tactical, and engineering operations
    
- Social hierarchies emphasize communal cooperation, survival skill mastery, and tactical ingenuity

### **Notes for Campaign Integration**

- Lizardfolk can serve as amphibious guides, environmental experts, or tactical NPCs
    
- Sszarath provides swamp, riverine, and jungle exploration opportunities for campaigns
    
- Overdose scenarios from Project: Sszarath Vanguard mutagens could create super-adapted Lizardfolk with unpredictable abilities, serving as allies, adversaries, or environmental hazards
