### **Mutagenic Adaptation Notes**

**Project: Selvanya Striker** — UL’s mutagenic enhancement program for Tabaxi:

- **Safe Dose:** Improves reflexes, balance, sensory acuity, and climbing/jumping capabilities
    
- **Overdose:** Triggers extreme agility, temporary muscle hyper-growth, enhanced perception, or limited gliding membrane development; implants required to stabilize effects
    
- **Control Integration:** Neural implants provide override, live translation, and coordination during field operations
