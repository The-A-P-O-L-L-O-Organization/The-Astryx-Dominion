**Species File — Tieflings**

**Homeworld:** _Inferalis Prime_  
**Galaxy:** Milky Way  
**Dominant Star-Nation(s):**

- **United Defense** — Tieflings’ resilience to extreme environments and innate infernal traits make them exceptional in high-risk operations and planetary security.
    
- **United Terraform** — Their adaptive biology allows them to survive harsh terraforming sites, including volcanic, acidic, and radiation-heavy zones.
    
- **United Cognition** — Tieflings excel in strategy, diplomacy, and intelligence operations, often serving as analysts or advisors in complex missions.

### **Overview**

Tieflings are humanoids with infernal heritage, often characterized by horns, tails, and a range of skin tones from deep reds to purples or ash. They possess natural resistances to fire, acid, and some radiation, alongside heightened endurance and perceptive abilities.

**Physiological Traits:**

- Height: 1.6–1.9 meters
    
- Weight: 60–85 kg
    
- Horns: Shape and size vary between subspecies and individuals
    
- Tail: Prehensile, used for balance, expression, and limited manipulation
    
- Eyes: Often solid colors (red, gold, violet), adapted for low-light vision

### **Homeworld: Inferalis Prime**

- **Type:** Volcanic and mountainous planet with molten rivers, lava plains, and subterranean caverns
    
- **Gravity:** 1.0–1.05g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Oxygen-nitrogen mix with trace sulfur and mineral gases; Tieflings tolerate higher acidity than most species
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 25–40°C
    

**Ecosystems:**

- Lava flows and molten plains support heat-resistant flora and fauna
    
- Subterranean networks allow habitation, trade, and research hubs
    
- Mineral-rich mountains provide raw materials for industry and experimentation
    

**Native Fauna:**

- _Pyroclast Drakes_ — small, fire-adapted dragon-like creatures
    
- _Magma Serpents_ — subterranean, heat-resistant predators
    
- _Infernal Beetles_ — metallic, lava-resistant insects used in research and bioengineering
    

**Environmental Traits:**

- Tieflings naturally thrive in high-heat, acidic, and radiation-heavy environments
    
- Prehensile tails assist in balance during climbing and navigating rugged terrain
    
- Infernal physiology grants partial resistance to fire, acid, and environmental toxins

### **Cultural Characteristics**

- **Core Ethos:** _“Endure, adapt, ascend.”_
    
- Societies are clan- or guild-based, emphasizing endurance, tactical planning, and infernal legacy
    
- Rituals often involve fire, lava, or elemental trials to demonstrate resilience and mastery
    
- Architecture blends volcanic stone fortresses, subterranean halls, and obsidian spires

### **Mutagenic Adaptation Notes**

**Project: Infernal Vanguard** — UL’s mutagenic enhancement program for Tieflings:

- **Safe Dose:** Enhances heat resistance, strength, reflexes, and infernal energy output
    
- **Overdose:** Triggers extreme elemental affinity (fire, acid, or energy bursts), temporary wings, or muscle hyper-growth; implants required to prevent uncontrollable effects
    
- **Control Integration:** Neural implants provide override, live translation, and enhanced situational awareness

### **Modern Integration**

- **Frontier Security:** Elite planetary defense units and extreme-environment operatives
    
- **Terraforming & Industrial Hazards:** Deployed in lava plains, acidic regions, and high-radiation areas
    
- **Strategic Planning & Intelligence:** Advisory roles, analysis, and operational strategy
    

---

### **Cultural Interactions**

- Tieflings collaborate with **Dragonborn**, **Kobolds**, and **Orcs** for high-risk missions
    
- Ritual enhancement practices and mutagenic trials are culturally respected
    
- Clans maintain volcanic and subterranean facilities for training, research, and deployment

### **Notes for Campaign Integration**

- Tieflings can act as NPC tacticians, environmental specialists, or extreme-environment operatives
    
- Inferalis Prime provides volcanic, subterranean, and hazardous planetary adventure opportunities
    
- Mutagen overdose or elemental surges can be plot hooks for temporary transformations, environmental disruption, or battlefield phenomena
