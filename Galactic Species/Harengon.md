## **Homeworld: Lapisveil**

- **Type:** Temperate planet with rolling plains, dense meadows, and scattered forests
    
- **Gravity:** 0.95g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Standard oxygen-nitrogen mix; breathable for most humanoids
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 15–28°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Open plains with natural speed corridors for movement and training
        
    - Flowering meadows supporting diverse insect and small fauna populations
        
    - Forested areas providing cover, nesting sites, and tactical observation points
        

**Native Fauna:**

- **Swiftgrass Hares:** Prey species that exhibit pack movement and evasive maneuvers
    
- **Skybeetles:** Small flying insects used for environmental monitoring
    
- **Meadow Stalkers:** Medium predators requiring Harengon agility and strategy for survival
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Harengons thrive in open and mixed terrains. Their agility makes them ideal for reconnaissance, rapid transport, and adaptive problem-solving in both natural and constructed environments.

## **Mutagenic Adaptation Notes**

**Project: Lapisveil Bolt** — UL’s mutagenic enhancement program for Harengons:

- **Safe Dose:** Increases speed, agility, sensory acuity, and reflexes.
    
- **Overdose:** Produces extreme burst-speed, heightened perception, temporary elastic limbs, and multi-directional coordination. Neural implants required to prevent accidental harm from hyper-mobility.
    
- **Control Integration:** Implants provide override, live translation, and task coordination for high-speed operations.
