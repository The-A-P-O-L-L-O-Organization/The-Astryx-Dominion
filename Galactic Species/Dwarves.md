### **Overview**

Dwarves are short, stocky humanoids with extraordinary strength, resilience, and natural affinity for stonework, metalcraft, and engineering. Their dense musculature and bone structure give them enhanced durability, making them suited for high-risk work and combat.

Dwarves possess **keen spatial reasoning**, exceptional memory for layouts, and fine manual dexterity, allowing them to manipulate machinery, forge intricate tools, and craft precision devices. Their cultures emphasize **craft, honor, and heritage**, with professional guilds and clan affiliations playing central societal roles.

### **Homeworld: Khazdran**

- **Type:** Rocky, mountainous planet with extensive underground cave systems
    
- **Gravity:** 1.05g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Standard oxygen-nitrogen mix; rich in trace metals (iron, copper, tungsten)
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 12–28°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Mountain ranges with abundant mineral veins
        
    - Subterranean bioluminescent fungi and crystal forests
        
    - Temperate valleys and lakes with engineered irrigation systems
        

**Native Fauna:**

- _Stoneback Behemoths_ — massive quadrupeds adapted to rocky terrain
    
- _Cave Serpents_ — predatory subterranean reptiles
    
- _Metalbeetles_ — mineral-rich exoskeleton; used in early metallurgy study
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Dwarves are highly resistant to cold and low-light conditions, capable of sustained work in caves or industrial environments. Their physiology allows extended periods of physical labor without fatigue compared to humans.
