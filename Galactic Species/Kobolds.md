### **Overview**

Kobolds are small, draconic humanoids with tails, scaled skin, and limited breath abilities (typically fire or chemical irritants). They are cunning, dexterous, and highly social, often operating in cooperative packs. Their physiology allows them to navigate tight spaces, climb with ease, and execute coordinated operations in both natural and artificial environments.

**Physiological Traits:**

- Height: 0.9–1.2 meters
    
- Weight: 20–35 kg
    
- Tail: Prehensile, used for balance and manipulation of tools
    
- Senses: Acute vision in low-light conditions; sensitive to vibrations and chemical cues

### **Homeworld: Kobrakia**

- **Type:** Rocky, volcanic-archipelagic planet with extensive cave networks
    
- **Gravity:** 1.0g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Nitrogen-oxygen mix with trace sulfur compounds; safe for most humanoids
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 18–30°C
    

**Ecosystems:**

- Volcanic highlands and lava-flows supporting resilient flora and fauna
    
- Extensive cave systems rich in mineral deposits and subterranean water reservoirs
    
- Sparse forests and rocky plateaus
    

**Native Fauna:**

- _Flameback Skitters_ — small, heat-resistant quadrupeds
    
- _Cave Mites_ — swarm creatures used in chemical extraction experiments
    
- _Obsidian Raptors_ — pack predators adapted to rocky terrain
    

**Environmental Traits:**

- Kobolds are highly adept at climbing, burrowing, and navigating confined or treacherous terrain
    
- Small size and agility allow for stealthy approaches and infiltration operations

### **Mutagenic Adaptation Notes**

**Project: Kobrakia Vanguard** — UL’s mutagenic enhancement program for Kobolds:

- **Safe Dose:** Improves reflexes, climbing ability, sensory acuity, and minor elemental resistance
    
- **Overdose:** Produces extreme agility, temporary regenerative effects, enhanced chemical or fire output, and heightened intelligence for complex tactical coordination
    
- **Control Integration:** Neural implants provide override, live translation, and pack coordination during field operations
    

---

### **Modern Integration**

- **Reconnaissance:** Frontline scouts for planetary security, hazardous environment surveys, and infiltration operations
    
- **Subterranean Industry:** Mining, resource extraction, and engineering in confined or dangerous environments
    
- **Robotics & Automation:** Swarm drone operations, precision engineering, and hazardous material handling
    

---

### **Cultural Interactions**

- Kobolds maintain alliances with **Dragonborn**, **Goblins**, and **Humans** for joint engineering, combat, and exploration operations
    
- Cooperative, pack-oriented behavior makes them effective team members in high-risk or precision tasks
    
- Clans celebrate tactical ingenuity, trap-setting, and technical problem-solving through competitions and rituals

### **Notes for Campaign Integration**

- Kobolds can serve as scouts, engineers, or tactical NPCs for players
    
- Kobrakia offers opportunities for subterranean exploration, treasure hunting, or industrial sabotage missions
    
- Overdose scenarios from Project: Kobrakia Vanguard mutagens could provide hooks for hyper-agile or hyper-intelligent Kobold threats or allies
