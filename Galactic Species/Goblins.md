### **Overview**

Goblins are small, agile humanoids with sharp features, large ears, and highly expressive faces. They possess **high dexterity, rapid learning abilities**, and a natural talent for mechanical and electronic tinkering.

Physiologically, goblins exhibit:

- Short stature (generally 1–1.3 meters tall) and lightweight frames, ideal for maneuverability.
    
- High metabolic rate, allowing rapid reaction times and quick bursts of energy.
    
- Exceptional hand-eye coordination and fine motor control, advantageous in crafting, hacking, or piloting tasks.

### **Homeworld: Kragmar**

- **Type:** Rocky, semi-industrialized planet with scattered forests and mountain ranges.
    
- **Gravity:** 0.9–1.0g
    
- **Atmosphere:** Earth-like, slightly higher nitrogen content; breathable without modifications.
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 12–28°C
    
- **Ecosystems:**
    
    - Rugged mountainous regions rich in minerals and metals.
        
    - Sparse forests with dense undergrowth used for concealment and wildlife studies.
        
    - Urban-industrial hubs filled with mechanical workshops, energy plants, and testing facilities.
        

**Native Fauna:**

- _Clatterbeetles_ — small, metallic-shelled insects often used as biological sensors or scavengers.
    
- _Stoneback Goats_ — hardy, sure-footed creatures adapted to Kragmar’s cliffs.
    
- _Volcanic Serpents_ — rare, semi-intelligent predators inhabiting geothermal areas.
    

**Environmental Traits:**  
Goblins are naturally adaptable to both urban-industrial and rugged natural terrain. They are particularly skilled at using existing resources to engineer tools, weapons, and structures.
