### **Overview**

Goliaths are towering, muscular humanoids with stone-like skin patterns and exceptional physical prowess. They possess high endurance, impressive strength, and a natural affinity for mountainous or harsh environments.

**Physiological Traits:**

- Height: 2–2.5 meters on average; robust, heavily muscled frames.
    
- Skin: Naturally resilient, mottled with stony patterns that provide minor camouflage in rocky terrain.
    
- Senses: Acute vision and hearing adapted for mountainous and rugged landscapes.
    
- Dexterity: Lower than smaller species, but capable of precise movement for heavy manipulation tasks.

### **Homeworld: Tharok**

- **Type:** Rocky, mountainous planet with deep canyons and sparse plateaus.
    
- **Gravity:** 1.1–1.2g — naturally builds strength and endurance.
    
- **Atmosphere:** Earth-like, slightly higher oxygen content; breathable without modification.
    
- **Average Surface Temp:** 5–22°C
    

**Ecosystems:**

- Craggy mountains rich in mineral deposits and cave networks.
    
- Sparse alpine forests and resilient grasslands in sheltered valleys.
    
- River systems fed by glacial melts, providing water for wildlife and agriculture.
    

**Native Fauna:**

- Stonehorn Beasts — large herbivores adapted to cliffs, often used as mounts.
    
- Cliff Rippers — predatory avian-like creatures, highly territorial.
    
- Glimmerfoxes — small, nocturnal creatures with reflective fur for low-light hunting.
    

**Environmental Traits:**

- Goliaths thrive in rugged, high-altitude terrain.
    
- Naturally resistant to cold and low oxygen environments.
    
- Strength and mass make them ideal for tasks requiring brute force or heavy lifting.
