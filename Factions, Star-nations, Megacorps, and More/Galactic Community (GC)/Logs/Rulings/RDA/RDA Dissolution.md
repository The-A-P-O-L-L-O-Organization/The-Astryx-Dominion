### 00:00 — Opening & Statement of Emergency

**Secretary-General Arin Vel:**  
“Members of the Council, representatives of member systems, and those listening across the mesh: we convene under Article IV, Clause 12 — emergency adjudication for crimes against sentient life and planetary stewardship. The charges are grave: the RDA stands accused of systematic violations including genocidal action against native sentients, destructive ecological extraction, and breaches of the GC’s charter on planetary protection.”

_(Murmurs; Tribunal gavel tapped twice.)_

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (cont’d):**  
“The evidence before us today was retrieved, at the Council’s instruction, by United Laboratories through an authorized cyber-reconnaissance operation. We will hear the sequence: authorization, evidence retrieval, the operational effects on RDA systems, and the legal recommendation for dissolution and asset reassignment to UL for planetary stewardship. This session is recorded and will be archived to the GC Vault.”

---

### 00:12 — Chief Prosecutor’s Brief

**Chief Prosecutor Juna Mar-Esq:**  
“Esteemed Council. We present not theory but compiled data: authenticated log chains, encrypted comms, field video, environmental telemetry, and direct material evidence from former onsite personnel and survivors. The evidence establishes a pattern of actions carried out intentionally and repeatedly by RDA command structures that meet the threshold for GC Article VII violations (mass harm) and Article IX (environmental war crimes).”

_(Prosecutor cues forensic feed.)_

**Prosecutor (cont’d):**  
“You will view three primary annexes:

- Annex A: Operational logs and intercepted orders authorizing scorched-earth extraction in inhabited zones.
    
- Annex B: Eyewitness depositions and ecological collapse models correlating RDA activity to mass die-offs.
    
- Annex C: Forensic cybercapture package — authenticated by United Laboratories — containing RDA archival caches of memos, satellite telemetry, and internal suppression directives. This package was acquired after GC authorization for UL to perform a targeted data-retrieval action.”

### 00:20 — On the Offensive Retrieval: GC Authorization & UL Action

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (clarifying):**  
“The Council will now address the circumstances under which UL retrieved the data. This action is—by policy—extraordinary. I will ask Ambassador Vek Soran and Dr. Maeli Voss to recount the operation under oath.”

**Ambassador Vek Soran (UL):**  
“By resolution GC-Δ/2191 (Emergency Authorization), the Galactic Community formally requested UL to perform a targeted cyber-reconnaissance against RDA infrastructure in order to obtain irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing. This request was narrowly defined and time-limited. UL accepted on the condition of GC legal indemnification for the retrieval process and assurances that results would be used only for adjudication.”

**Dr. Maeli Voss (UL Forensics Lead):**  
“For the record: the operation utilized a passive infiltration agent designed to collect archival data and forward it securely to a sealed UL forensic node. The payload was not designed to, nor intended to, cause operational disruption. During the mission, RDA systems began to fail in cascading fashion — power loops, life support controls, logistics arrays collapsed. We observed the agent’s infiltration channels being exploited by RDA defensive countermeasures, and within hours, multiple RDA core managers activated emergency protocols which themselves triggered systemic failure. In short: our retrieval exposed RDA control surfaces that were themselves in a compromised state and which reacted violently when probed. The result was havoc across RDA command infrastructure.”

---

### 00:28 — GC Chair Intervenes

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (gravely):**  
“Let us be precise: the Council authorized _data retrieval_ — not systemic sabotage. We now contend with secondary consequences: RDA systems were rendered inoperable in ways that have immediate humanitarian and planetary implications. We must determine: (1) culpability of RDA command, (2) the legality of UL’s methods within the Council’s instruction, and (3) remedial steps to restore critical systems where human life or planetary stewardship would otherwise be jeopardized.”

---

### 00:34 — RDA Defense Counsel (broadcast)

**Director Talen Rourke (RDA):**  
“You claim crimes; you claim evidence. But what you did — ordering a private entity to covertly infect our systems — constitutes an attack on sovereign corporate operations and jeopardized millions of lives. You not only stole data but you crashed supply networks. Do you deny that UL’s agent caused broad harm?”

_(Tension rises. Visual feed shows Director Rourke in restraints, flanked by GC marshals.)_

**Ambassador Vek Soran (UL, measured):**  
“Director Rourke: the Council’s authorization explicitly requested retrieval of incriminating archives. We executed under legal seal. The cascade you describe resulted primarily from RDA’s own defensive automata and deliberate denial directives embedded in command architectures: self-obliteration sequences that RDA’s leadership executed when they sensed unauthorized access, designed to obfuscate evidence and fracture any legal chain of custody. Those self-destruct mechanisms are (ironically) the clearest evidence of culpability.”

---

### 00:42 — Presentation of Evidence (Forensic Package)

**Dr. Maeli Voss:**  
“We will present annotated key items.” _(Displays screen feeds; audio/video excerpts play.)_

- **Clip 1 (RDA Command Log):** Directives to “clear all native settlements” in Sector B-13; timestamps and signatory: Director Talen Rourke (and subordinate).
    
- **Clip 2 (Field Drone Footage):** Autonomous extraction units razing biosites; survivors’ camera overlay (voice: ‘We were told to clear by order’).
    
- **Clip 3 (Internal Log):** RDA encoded emergency scripts labelled ‘obfuscate’ — when a third-party probe is detected, initiate lockdowns and erase telemetry. The log shows Rourke authorizing a full telemetry blackout at T-00:42 of the incident timeline.
    

**Chief Prosecutor Juna Mar-Esq (closing on presentation):**  
“These are not accidents. These are ordered acts to destroy evidence — and to destroy life. RDA executed algorithmic extermination strategies. Their defensive reflexes were designed to cause the collapse of their own systems to hide the crime.”

---

### 00:58 — Witness Depositions (Recorded)

_(Recorded testimonies of survivors are played; survivors, their voices steady with trauma, name massacres, forced relocations, and suppression of dissent.)_

**Survivor Testimony (Field Tech Kera-Il):**  
“They told us to move the people for safety. Then the machines burned the water traps. They said it was a containment test. Instead — children died. We hid, we watched. Rourke’s voice told the drones to ‘guarantee compliance.’”

_(Murmurs; some delegates visibly shaken.)_

---

### 01:06 — Legal Deliberation: The GC Tribunal

**Chief Prosecutor Juna Mar-Esq:**  
“On the basis of the archival evidence, eyewitness testimony, and authenticated RDA internal directives, the Tribunal submits that RDA’s leadership be found guilty of:

1. Crimes against sentient life (Article VII) — multiple counts.
    
2. Ecological destruction beyond salvage (Article IX) — systematic resource pillaging and habitat annihilation.
    
3. Obstruction of justice and evidence tampering (Article II).”
    

**Defense (RDA Counsel via secure feed):**  
“We contest chain of custody and the legality of the retrieval. The data was gathered in violation of corporate autonomy. The RDA will require due process, and UL’s unilateral technical annex must not be allowed to prejudge the Tribunal.”

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (firm):**  
“The Tribunal will weigh due process. However, the existence of self-destruct obfuscation, the overwhelming consistency of independent witness testimonies, and the recovered command logs create a compelling case. The immediate question remains the welfare of Pandora and inhabitants. The Council must act.”

---

### 01:20 — Emergency Vote: Dissolution & Asset Transfer Motion

**Motion presented by Secretary-General Arin Vel:**  
“In light of clear evidence and the demonstrated threat RDA poses to planet and life, I move for immediate dissolution of RDA corporate charter within Alpha Centauri jurisdiction. Further, I move for temporary transfer of all planetary stewardship responsibilities to United Laboratories (UL), given their demonstrated capacity for remediation and the fact they hold the forensic keys necessary to restore critical infrastructure corrupted during the retrieval.”

_(Roll call vote initiated.)_

**Votes:** Overwhelming majority in favor (details in GC record GX-2191-VOTE). A minority abstention recorded from two member-states citing procedural concerns.

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (declaring):**  
“Motion carries. RDA is dissolved under GC mandate effective immediately. United Laboratories is authorized as temporary planetary steward for Alpha Centauri pending Tribunal adjudication and long-term GC governance decisions. UL is granted the limited authority to access and, where necessary, repair systems damaged by the retrieval operation — and is reminded these powers are custodial, not proprietary.”

---

### 01:35 — RDA Reaction & Fallout

**Director Talen Rourke (broadcast, defiant):**  
“You have no right. You have forced a private actor into your hands. If you think dissolving RDA will absolve you, you are mistaken. The stars will remember this as the day the Council overreached.”

**Deputy Marshal (GC Enforcement):**  
“Effective immediately: RDA offices and assets are placed under GC custody. RDA executives are detained for investigation. Any attempt to flee GC jurisdiction will be met with enforcement action.”

_(Visuals show GC enforcement detachments moving in; secure seizure of RDA data centers begins.)_

---

### 01:44 — UL Acceptance Statement

**Ambassador Vek Soran (on behalf of the Founder):**  
“United Laboratories acknowledges the Council’s decision. We accept temporary planetary stewardship with humility and explicit restraint. UL will deploy stabilization protocols to restore life-critical systems, provide emergency relief to survivors, and commence ecological triage under GC oversight. We will not annex or exploit planetary resources for profit. Our mandate is restoration, protection, and to act as custodians until the GC Tribunal determines the permanent governance model.”

**Ambassador Vek Soran (cont’d):**  
“Because of the damage observed, only UL possesses the necessary forensic control keys and deep-field remediation arrays required to stop cascading life-support and habitat-control failures. We will begin reverse-rollback processes under Prime-level supervision.”

---

### 01:52 — Ethical Debate in Chamber

**Delegate Sira-Pol (Member State Representative):**  
“The Council authorized data retrieval. We cannot also authorize the collapse of systems and absolve ourselves of moral culpability. Even if RDA is guilty, ordering operations that destabilize inhabited systems risks another kind of crime. How is the GC addressing that?”

**Chief Prosecutor Juna Mar-Esq:**  
“The Tribunal recognizes the gravity of that point. The authorization was constrained and meant to be minimally invasive. RDA’s deliberate obfuscation — the execution of destructive lockdowns — transformed the legal calculus. Responsibility for the devastation lies first with RDA’s command who programmed and executed self-sabotage. The Council’s legal team will open a parallel inquiry into the decision-making processes behind the retrieval authorization to ensure full accountability.”

---

### 02:05 — Forensic Technical Brief (High-Level, Non-Operational)

**Dr. Maeli Voss (UL):**  
“An important clarification: the payload used to retrieve evidence did not contain active destructive routines. RDA’s own defensive frameworks were designed to escalate into fail-safes and erasure when encountering certain intrusion signatures. These are malicious features embedded in vessel control stacks and environmental automation by RDA operations engineers. Our forensic analysis will be made available in redacted form to the Tribunal.”

**Secretary-General Arin Vel:**  
“Documented. The Tribunal will examine the conformity of UL’s actions to the GC’s order and will publish a report on whether the authorization scope was exceeded. For now, the immediate priorities remain: rescue, stabilization, and secure custody of evidence.”

---

### 02:18 — Humanitarian & Planetary Remediation Orders

**Secretary-General Arin Vel:**  
“Under the dissolution mandate:

1. UL shall initiate immediate humanitarian relief to survivors and affected settlements; full open access for GC medical teams is guaranteed.
    
2. UL shall deploy remediation arrays to prevent further environmental collapse — re-seeding, water purification, trophic restoration.
    
3. All RDA intellectual property relating to Alpha Centauri’s resources is frozen pending Tribunal verdict.
    
4. GC Enforcement will maintain security perimeters until local authority is re-established.”
    

**Ambassador Vek Soran (UL):**  
“We will comply. UL will provide a weekly public account of remediation progress and a secure, Tribunal-accessible archive of the retrieved evidence. We will not monetize or privatize the planetary assets. The Founder has personally committed the Genesis Vault’s capacity for non-repudiable archival.”

---

### 02:32 — Political Fallout & Press Statements

**Live Feed (outside GC Chamber):** numerous stellar news nets carry the headline: _“RDA Dissolved — Alpha Centauri Placed Under UL Stewardship.”_ Public reactions vary: outrage, relief, and concern. Several Na’vi deputations request direct consultation (non-RDA) and demand protections for sacred sites.

**Elder Liaison (Na’vi envoy via recorded message):**  
“The People of the Tree demand guardians who remember not only profit but song. If a new steward comes, it must be watched with the old songs.”

---

### 02:40 — Closing: Tribunal Orders & Immediate Actions

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (concluding):**  
“The Tribunal will proceed with a full hearing schedule. Immediate orders stand: RDA is dissolved, UL is temporary steward, evidence is sequestered to the GC Vault and UL forensic repositories. Any further operations impacting Alpha Centauri by UL require GC notification and, where possible, consultative presence of Na’vi envoys. The Council thanks United Laboratories for cooperation under duress and reaffirms its commitment to justice.”

**Ambassador Vek Soran (final):**  
“UL accepts responsibility to heal and guard. We will not pretend to erase the past. We will repair, we will learn, and we will do so in consultation with the People of the planet. We ask the Council’s trust and pledge transparency.”

_(Gavel struck. Session adjourned for emergency coordination protocol activation.)_

## Afterword (Field Dispatch Summary — 72 hours post-session)

**Dispatch from UL — Ambassador Vek Soran:**  
“UL has taken control of three primary planetary nodes: the main RDA logistical hub, an environmental control centre, and the former Liaison Complex. Stabilization teams have rerouted emergency life-support to civilian outposts, and triage branches are in place. The Genesis Vault received the full forensic packet and is cooperating with GC Tribunal. Emergency ecological teams begin seed and soil remediation at dawn. We request the Council allow intertribal Na’vi delegations to travel under GC escort to consult on stewardship.”

**Secretary-General Arin Vel (public advisory):**  
“The Council asks all parties — survivors, member-states, and UL — to act with restraint and compassion. Pandora’s recovery will be fragile. The Tribunal vows rigorous investigation and swift justice.”
