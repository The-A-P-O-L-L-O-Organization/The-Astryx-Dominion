### **Galactic Community (GC) — Overview**
**Purpose:**
- Acts as an interstellar governing and judicial body.
- Coordinates diplomacy, trade standards, environmental protection, and conflict arbitration between star-nations.
- Can **pass galactic laws and mandates** that theoretically affect all member civilizations.

**Structure:**
- **Representative Council:** One representative from each recognized star-nation/faction, including UL.
- **Judicial Tribunal:** Arbitration for interstellar disputes, treaty enforcement, and war crimes.
- **Legislative Assembly:** Passes GC-wide laws on technology proliferation, trade, and environmental/resource management.
- **Emergency Council:** Can declare galaxy-wide measures in existential crises.

**Powers:**
- All star-nations are _technically bound_ to follow GC laws.
- GC laws cover: trade, research ethics, planetary governance, resource exploitation, military escalation, cross-species rights, and more.
- GC rulings are enforced by a combination of member star-nation fleets and GC peacekeeping forces.

### **UL’s Position in Relation to GC**
- **Paragovernmental Status:** UL operates beyond typical state jurisdiction, answering only to Founder-level governance.
- **Compliance:**
    - UL generally **follows GC laws voluntarily** to maintain diplomatic and commercial relations.
    - UL **may disregard or modify GC mandates** if they:
        1. Impede critical research (e.g., Pantheon Genome, God Forge, Singularity).
        2. Conflict with stricter internal UL protocols.
        3. Threaten operational sovereignty or security.
- **Political Leverage:** UL participates in GC council and committees, influencing law-making and galaxy-wide policies to favor innovation and scientific freedom.

### **Practical Dynamics**
1. **Alliances & Voting:**
    - UL’s votes carry weight, but the GC is consensus-driven. UL’s unique capabilities (Aeonborn oversight, megaprojects, energy control) give it _de facto authority_ in science, planetary management, and defense.
    
2. **Conflict Resolution:**
    - UL can be summoned to GC tribunals for interstellar disputes but may **invoke paragovernmental exceptions**.
    - UL representatives (or Aeonborn delegates) negotiate compromises without fully ceding autonomy.
    
3. **Legal Safeguards:**
    - UL has **self-imposed higher ethical & legal frameworks** that surpass GC requirements.
    - Any GC law attempting to restrict critical UL research triggers automatic **Founder-level review**.
    
4. **Public Relations:**
    - UL publicly **endorses GC initiatives** for diplomacy while quietly preserving independence.
    - Megaprojects like Pantheon Genome, Genesis Vault, and Singularity are presented as **galaxy-benefit initiatives**, reducing friction.
