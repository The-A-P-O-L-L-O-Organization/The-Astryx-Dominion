Clearance levels follow the **Greek alphabet** hierarchy, with “Prime” variants denoting a higher tier. Access determines operational authority, AI interaction rights, and project knowledge.

| **Clearance**          | **Description / Access**                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha (Α)**          | Entry-level clearance; allows access to non-sensitive operational data and public UL interfaces.                |
| **Alpha Prime (Α’)**   | Higher than Alpha; can access low-level project files, routine frontier mission data, and restricted logs.      |
| **Beta (Β)**           | Mid-level clearance; can query subfunctions and monitor project progress under supervision.                     |
| **Beta Prime (Β’)**    | Enhanced Beta; access to restricted missions, limited AI subfunction controls, and confidential logs.           |
| **Gamma (Γ)**          | Advanced operational access; eligible for cross-system coordination and some autonomous mission authority.      |
| **Gamma Prime (Γ’)**   | High-level operational clearance; can initiate AI queries for sensitive subfunctions and interstellar planning. |
| **Delta (Δ)**          | Expert-level access; can authorize minor project modifications or resource reallocations.                       |
| **Delta Prime (Δ’)**   | Senior authority; can oversee project teams and approve certain autonomous AI operations.                       |
| **Epsilon (Ε)**        | UL management access; can direct frontier operations and access internal UL correspondence.                     |
| **Epsilon Prime (Ε’)** | Senior management; access to subfunction integration decisions and high-level mission coordination.             |
| **Zeta (Ζ)**           | Executive operational clearance; oversees multiple projects, including Aeon Spire deployments.                  |
| **Zeta Prime (Ζ’)**    | Near-top clearance; can authorize intergalactic AI directives and high-level strategic planning.                |
| **Eta (Η)**            | Top-tier operational clearance; direct oversight of all mission-critical systems and UL security protocols.     |
| **Eta Prime (Η’)**     | Executive-level; can interface with Mnemosyne directly, review classified AI subfunction data.                  |
| **Theta (Θ)**          | Ultra-high clearance; access to classified interstellar projects, including Aurora Veil operations.             |
| **Theta Prime (Θ’)**   | Reserved for Founder-level executives; can override AI protocols and authorize extraordinary operations.        |
| **Iota (Ι)** → …       | Clearance continues up the Greek alphabet as needed for internal gradations of specialized authority.           |
| **Omega (Ω)**          | Highest operational authority; direct control of cross-project integrations and critical mission directives.    |
| **Omega Prime (Ω’)**   | **Founder-level clearance**; unrestricted access to all UL data, AI, subfunctions, and classified projects.     |

### **Additional Notes on Clearance Usage**

- **Prime Variants:** Denote elevated authority within each tier; typically used for supervisors, senior officers, or advanced operatives.
- **Clearance Enforcement:** AIs like **System, Theseus, and SHADOW** enforce access control and track attempted unauthorized access.
- **Project Access:**
    - **New Dawn**: Gamma Prime or higher for subfunction oversight, Beta Prime or higher for research access.
    - **Obsidian Eye**: Beta Prime or higher to authorize mission queries; Theta or above for covert operation oversight.
    - **Aeon Spire**: Gamma or higher for field deployment; Delta Prime or higher for construction authorization.
    - **Aurora Veil**: Theta or higher for stealth operations; Omega Prime for project-wide directives.
