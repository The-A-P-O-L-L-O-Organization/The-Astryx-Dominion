### **United Laboratories Facility Dossier — HADAL Sub-Menagerie Alpha-12 (Abandoned)**

**Designation:** HADAL Sub-Menagerie Alpha-12  
**Location:** Hadal Trench Z-13, UL Sector O-7, Exoplanet Omega-5  
**Operational Status:** Decommissioned / Abandoned  
**Original Function:** Creation, testing, and containment of mutagens for oceanic biomes  
**Date of Abandonment:** ██████████

---

### **Facility Overview:**

**Purpose:**

- HADAL Sub-Menagerie Alpha-12 was originally constructed for high-pressure, deep-ocean experimentation on both aquatic and hybridized subjects.
    
- Specialized in mutagenic research focused on extreme pressure adaptation, aquatic hybrid physiology, and behavioral conditioning.
    
- Served as a testbed for mutagens later deployed at other UL sites or integrated into larger menagerie operations.
    

**Capacity:**

- Containment: 42 experimental tanks designed for humanoid and aquatic hybrid subjects.
    
- Laboratory Stations: 6 mutagen synthesis labs, 4 behavioral testing chambers.
    
- Storage: 12 secure vaults for mutagens, experimental logs, and research equipment.
    

**Architecture & Design:**

- Structure: Cylindrical and dome-shaped modules interlocked along trench walls, partially embedded in natural rock for pressure stability.
    
- Hull: Multi-layered ultra-dense alloys and adaptive polymers; externally coated with bioluminescent signaling panels.
    
- Observation Domes: Reinforced pressure domes providing external trench views for behavioral monitoring.
    
- Docking & Access: Pressurized bay for deep-sea vehicles and automated supply modules; reinforced airlocks.
    

**Interior Layout:**

- Containment Chambers: Cylindrical tanks with adjustable fluid composition, restraint mechanisms, and integrated monitoring.
    
- Laboratories: High-tech, sterile spaces for mutagen synthesis, gene editing, and behavioral study.
    
- Corridors: Narrow, pressurized pathways connecting modules; magnetic treads for personnel in high-current simulations.
    
- Control Hub: Centralized command room with holographic data feeds, subject monitoring, and environmental control.
    
- Security Systems: Automated sentries, pressure-sensitive floors, and emergency containment doors.

### **Operational History:**

- **Construction:** ███████ – established as one of the first deep-ocean HADAL facilities for mutagenic research.
    
- **Peak Use:** ███████ – Alpha-12 functioned at full capacity, producing multiple experimental hybrid specimens and mutagen prototypes.
    
- **Decline:** █████ – Advances in mutagen synthesis and containment technologies rendered Alpha-12 less efficient than newer HADAL sites.
    
- **Decommissioning:** █████ – Relinquished active status in favor of a more advanced HADAL site (HADAL-Ω), remaining on standby until full deactivation.
    
- **Abandonment:** Facility was left intact but minimally powered; automated security systems remained active to prevent unauthorized access.

### **Security & Containment Measures:**

- **Active Systems (Residual):**
    
    - Pressure-sensitive alarms detecting unauthorized access.
        
    - Automated turrets and containment nets capable of neutralizing intruders or escaped subjects.
        
    - Motion and sonar sensors monitoring water column and interior modules.
        
- **Inactive Systems:**
    
    - Most research stations and environmental controls are non-functional; power limited to basic security and life-support functions.
        
    - Containment tanks maintain minimal pressure and temperature to prevent catastrophic structural failure.
        
- **Self-Destruct Protocol:**
    
    - Facility programmed for remote self-destruction in the event of unauthorized breach, ensuring mutagens, data, and specimens are not compromised.
        

---

### **Notable Events & Incidents:**

- Multiple containment breaches recorded in the final operational cycles; hybrid subjects occasionally escaped experimental tanks but were recaptured with minimal loss.
    
- Unauthorized intrusion in █████ led to a partial purge of sensitive data and mutagens.
    
- Abandonment left automated systems in place, later triggering alarms during the raiders’ attack in █████., which prompted United Security intervention.

### **Post-Abandonment Notes:**

- Alpha-12 is now considered a **hazardous, discarded site**; it contains residual mutagens, partially active containment systems, and unstable structural elements.
    
- Observation indicates significant deterioration of interior structures; some tanks are compromised, allowing partial escape of former test subjects.
    
- The facility’s remote location in the Hadal Trench of Omega-5 ensures minimal interference with inhabited areas but poses significant risk to unauthorized explorers.
    
- UL’s automated monitoring systems remain functional enough to report breaches, activate defensive protocols, and trigger eventual self-destruction once cargo is removed.

**Conclusion:**  
HADAL Sub-Menagerie Alpha-12 serves as a **relic of early mutagenic research**: a structurally imposing, high-pressure laboratory that has been discarded yet remains a hazardous environment. Its abandonment allows narrative opportunities for raids, accidental exposure, and encounters with freed or lingering hybrid subjects, while demonstrating UL’s meticulous control and operational redundancy.
