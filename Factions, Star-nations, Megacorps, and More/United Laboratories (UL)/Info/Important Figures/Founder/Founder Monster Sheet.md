_Legendary NPC — CR 30_

A living synthesis of biology, psionics, and the finest UL engineering. He moves like intelligence given form: deliberate, impossibly fast in thought and action, and always watching. The Founder prefers diplomacy and demonstration, but when pushed he can become a battlefield’s architect — bending tech, terrain, and minds to his will. Info about him can be found at [[Founder Info (WIP)]] and [[Founder Public Info]]. His has access to all of [[Founder Toolkit]]

## Special Traits

**Dual-State Neurology (Recharge 5–6).** The Founder can shift between **Strategic Mode** and **Instinctual Mode** as a bonus action.

- _Strategic Mode:_ +2 to AC, advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws, and his attacks deal an extra 3d8 radiant damage.
- _Instinctual Mode:_ +10 ft. to speed, advantage on Dexterity saving throws and Acrobatics checks, and his melee attacks deal an extra 3d8 force damage.

**Psionic Synchronization Core.** The Founder shares a passive telepathic network with allies within 300 ft. Allied creatures gain +2 to initiative and may use a reaction to take the Dodge action if the Founder is within 60 ft.

**System Link (Constant).** While within range of active electronics or a connected network, the Founder can sense devices and data flows within 1 mile; he has advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks related to systems and may use an action to attempt a System Override (see Actions).

**Radiant Shell.** When reduced to 0 HP, the Radiant Shell activates automatically once per long rest, granting 50 temporary hit points and immediately stabilizing the Founder for 1 minute while draining energy (during which he cannot cast or use System Link). If the Founder would be reduced to 0 HP again while the shell is active, he instead becomes incapacitated but stable (healing resumes normally afterward).

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Founder fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Founder makes three attacks, or uses two attacks and one System Action, or uses one attack and two Special Actions.

**Omni-Strike (Melee).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3d10 + 10 force damage plus 3d8 radiant damage. On a critical hit, target is pushed 15 ft. and must succeed on a DC 23 Strength save or be knocked prone.

**Psionic Lance (Ranged).** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +17 to hit, range 300 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12d8 psychic damage. Target that fails a DC 23 Intelligence save is stunned until the end of the Founder’s next turn. Creatures immune to psychic damage halve the damage and are not stunned.

**System Override (Action).** The Founder targets a single technological or magical electronic-like system (ship subsystems, AI construct, arcane device, or active spell glyph). The target must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw or be _hacked_: Effects include immediate shutdown, temporary control by the Founder until the target's next next next turn, or forced rerouting of power. Against creatures wearing or using technology, the creature must make the save; on a failure they suffer 6d10 lightning damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. The Founder can choose one of these effects upon success/failure. Targets immune to technological influence are immune.

**Mind Bridge (Recharge 6).** The Founder reaches out psionically and forms a temporary mental bond with up to 6 willing creatures within 120 ft. For 1 minute, bonded creatures can communicate telepathically with one another, share one action each turn (the Founder may redirect one of their actions per round), and gain advantage on saves vs. fear and charm effects.

## Reactions

**Adaptive Parry.** When hit by an attack, the Founder can impose a −5 penalty to the attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. If the attack still hits, reduce damage by 20.

**Neural Countermeasure (3/day).** When a hostile creature attempts to cast a charm/dominate-like effect or gains control of a mind within 120 ft., the Founder can use his reaction to attempt an immediate dispel: the caster must succeed on a DC 25 Charisma save or have their effect end; if the effect is technology-based, the Founder gains control instead.

## Legendary Actions

The Founder can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Founder regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Attack.** Makes one Omni-Strike.
- **System Command (Costs 2).** The Founder uses System Override on a target within 300 ft. (DC 25).
- **Omniform Shift (Costs 2).** The Founder or one willing ally within 60 ft. gains one Omniform trait for 1 minute (wings for flight, gills for water breathing, temporary tail granting reach and +2 to Athletics, or temporary reinforced limbs granting +2 AC). These bonuses stack with other effects but last only 1 minute.
- **Inspire Resolve (Costs 3).** Up to six allied creatures within 120 ft. regain 6d8 + 10 hit points and gain advantage on saving throws until the end of their next turn.

## Lair Actions

When fighting in his mansion, a UL facility, or terrain linked to his systems, the Founder can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), he chooses one to occur:

- **SHADOW Probe.** SHADOW (represented as a force) launches a hollow-fog packet that hacks enemy devices within 200 ft.: devices suffer −2 to attack rolls or save Throws, and creatures using tech must succeed on DC 24 Intelligence saves or be unable to use those devices for 1 minute.
- **Nanofab Swarm.** Repair nanites burst from the ground and target allies: up to three allies recover 8d8 hit points and gain temporary resistance to one damage type (chosen by the Founder).
- **EM Null Field.** Create a wave of EM dampening in a 120-ft. radius: constructs and technological weapons in the area have disadvantage on attack rolls and checks until the next round.
- **Psionic Ripple.** Enemies within 90 ft. must make a DC 23 Wisdom save or have their speed halved and suffer disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.

## Regional Effects

While The Founder is present and actively connected to a facility or pocket domain (mansion, capital district, or flagship), the surrounding region has subtle protections and anomalies: chronic uplink stability, minor healing fields in public access zones, and electronic redundancy that makes scrying or remote surveillance against UL parties unreliable. These effects recede if he leaves for more than 1 week.

## Tactical Notes & Roleplay Guidance

- **Use sparingly.** The Founder is an extremely high-level NPC intended for climactic encounters, demonstrations of power, or as a story anchor. He’s usually not a combatant — when he fights, he changes the battlefield.    
- **Prefer control and deterrence.** In play, he should attempt to disable threats and seize the narrative (hacking enemy assets, rescuing civilians, coercing commanders into surrender) before resorting to lethal force.
- **Legendary presence.** The Founder’s appearance should alter the scene: lights dim, subtle hum of systems align, allied forces gain confidence. Let his presence drive roleplay: negotiations, moral dilemmas, and awe.
- **Scaling.** For lower-level tables, use a weakened variant (lower HP, fewer legendary actions, lower DCs) or present him as a remnant holographic test rather than fully embodied.
