## Official visual synopsis (public)

**Name / Title:** The Founder — Founder & Chief Executive, United Laboratories  
**Public appearance style:** Ceremonial / functional — bespoke garments that accommodate a range of movement and subtly emphasize leadership without ostentation.

**Headline features (publicly visible):**

- Humanoid silhouette with _noticeable augmentations_: observers report two additional forearms worn confidently and a long, expressive tail that moves with purpose.
    
- Large, retractable wings visible at certain moments — typically sheathed during indoor conversations, deployed only in demonstration zones or outdoor sanctuaries.
    
- Skin displays soft, patterned bioluminescent accents that pulse faintly in low light; patterns are widely described as “species-dot motifs” and considered ornamental and symbolic.
    
- Eyes are intense and focused; observers often describe a presence of layered perception (people say he seems to notice small details before they happen).
    
- Clothing is modular and adaptive — flowing robes or fitted tunics that open and close to reveal or conceal additional limbs and wing structures as circumstances require.

## 2) Publicly observed Omega Form V2 elements (what guests have actually seen)

> NOTE: These are _observations_ from public demonstrations, summit walkthroughs, and press photographs. They reflect visible traits and ceremonial behavior; they do **not** document private capabilities or classified systems.

- **Additional limbs:** Two extra arms have been observed in public settings. They are used deliberately (greeting, signing documents, demonstrating tools) and move with fluid coordination — not awkward or prosthetic-like.
    
- **Tail mobility:** The tail is visibly prehensile and expressive — used for balance on stage platforms, subtle gestural emphasis in speeches, and occasionally to steady objects during demonstrations.
    
- **Wings (retractable):** Wings are usually sheathed in indoor venues. In controlled demos or when moving through open areas, the wings may extend for short, dignified glides or ceremonial displays.
    
- **Adaptive integument:** Public photographs show subtle changes in skin texture and coloration depending on lighting and backdrop — described in press as “mood-patterning” or aesthetic shifts rather than dramatic biological transformations.
    
- **Bioluminescent accents:** In low light (evening receptions, demonstration halls), faint luminescent dots and vein-like patterns are visible and are often photographed. They are typically decorative, used to signal in performances or rituals.
    
- **Calm, deliberate movement:** Observers consistently note a controlled and confident gait, with gestures that suggest practiced coordination across all limbs.
    
- **Public interfaces:** The Founder sometimes uses gesture-driven holo-notes and focus devices in public; at a distance, attendees report seeing him making motions that produce unseen holographic annotations.

## 3) How the public and dignitaries typically react

- **Awe & curiosity:** Scientists and innovators are often visibly eager to meet him; many approach with technical questions or brief prototyping pitches.
    
- **Respectful deference:** Diplomats and corporate representatives show formal respect; clearance levels and protocol etiquette are often offered proactively.
    
- **Subtle unease:** Some attendees (particularly more conservative or tradition-bound delegates) maintain a measured distance, described as a mixture of reverence and caution.
    
- **Inspiration & PR value:** For UL and allied factions, his presence is a morale and PR boost — attendees crowd to watch demonstrations and to be photographed nearby.

## 4) Public talking points & permitted descriptions (for press / players)

- “The Founder embodies UL’s mission to unite biology and technology responsibly.”
    
- “Public appearances focus on innovation, collaboration, and ethical oversight.”
    
- “Adaptive attire and graceful movement are elements of public symbolism and demonstrative tech; specifics remain under UL stewardship.”
    

(These are safe, public-facing lines the party can cite when introducing or discussing the Founder.)

## 5) Roleplay hooks & NPC cues (how to use this in sessions)

- **Crowd effect:** When the Founder enters a room, have NPCs fall silent for a beat; PCs receive a small temporary morale/inspiration bonus (optional mechanic) or an intimidation check for less confident NPCs.
    
- **Curious scientist approach:** An NPC rushes the PCs after the Founder passes with a prototype pitch or a rumor about an open demo — perfect to seed a side quest.
    
- **Diplomatic tension:** A xenophobic delegate stiffens visibly when the Founder extends his wings in a public demo — use this to spark a political scene.
    
- **Photograph clue:** A smear or unexpected artifact shows up in a public photo of the Founder (a cryptic symbol on the wing membrane) — a lead for a mystery or conspiracy thread.
    
- **Personal moment:** If a PC has prior UL ties, arrange a short private greeting where the Founder nods and offers a cryptic personal line; this fuels character development without revealing secrets.

## 6) Quick handout (one-paragraph, player-facing)

> **Founder — Public Visual Brief:** At public events the Founder presents as a charismatic, highly augmented leader: humanoid with two extra forearms, an expressive prehensile tail, and retractable wings that are deployed only in demonstrations and open sanctuaries. Subtle bioluminescent patterns and adaptive attire make him memorable; his movement and presence command attention. Witnesses describe a sober mix of inspiration and cautious respect — an icon of UL’s promise and its potency.
