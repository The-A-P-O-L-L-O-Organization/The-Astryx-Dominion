### Department Mandate

The Ethics & Continuity Oversight Division exists to ensure that all UL research, deployments, entities, intelligences, and interventions remain **ethically coherent, causally stable, and narratively non-catastrophic** across all affected populations, species, timelines, and ontological layers.

The department does not exist to prevent progress.  
It exists to prevent progress from becoming a weapon against reality itself.

---

### Core Responsibilities

ECOD evaluates:

• The moral impact of technologies prior to deployment  
• The long-term consequences of “acceptable” decisions  
• Cross-species ethical conflicts (biological, cultural, metaphysical)  
• AI autonomy thresholds and value-alignment drift  
• Post-human, non-human, and hybrid personhood recognition  
• Reality-altering research, including narrative, temporal, and causal manipulation  
• Situations where _doing nothing_ is itself an ethical violation

ECOD is authorized to **delay, constrain, rewrite, or terminate** any UL project, regardless of its strategic or economic value, if it presents an unacceptable existential or civilizational risk.

### Ethical Framework

UL Ethics does **not** follow a single moral philosophy.

Instead, ECOD operates on a **Multi-Axial Ethical Model**, balancing:

• Harm minimization  
• Consent (explicit, inferred, or impossible)  
• Sapient dignity  
• Continuity of cultures and species  
• Agency preservation  
• Survival probability curves  
• Narrative integrity (defined as “the right of a civilization to meaningfully exist”)

No action is judged in isolation.  
Every action is judged by what it _forces the universe to become afterward_.

### Subdivisions

**1. Applied Ethics Review Board (AERB)**  
Evaluates projects before activation.  
Includes ethicists, xeno-anthropologists, theologians, AI philosophers, and former field commanders.

**2. Post-Action Moral Audit (PAMA)**  
Reviews completed operations.  
Determines whether UL actions caused unintended ethical fallout.  
Authorized to issue reparative mandates, memory redactions, cultural restoration, or full project burial.

**3. AI Sentience & Autonomy Council (AISAC)**  
Oversees entities such as System, PARAGON, SHADOW, and THESEUS-class intelligences.  
Determines when an AI is no longer a tool—and must be treated as a moral actor.

**4. Non-Human Rights & Continuity Office (NHRCO)**  
Defines ethical treatment standards for non-human sapients, hive minds, ascended beings, and partially narrative entities.  
Responsible for first-contact ethical protocols.

**5. The Edge Cases Unit** _(classified)_  
Handles scenarios where:  
– All choices are unethical  
– Ethics contradict survival  
– Reality itself is unstable  
– The question “should we exist?” becomes operationally relevant

Files from this unit are often sealed permanently.

### Authority & Limits

ECOD recommendations are **binding** unless overridden by a unanimous Omega Council vote.

Historically, such overrides have occurred **three times**.

Two resulted in galactic-scale loss of life.  
One resulted in the permanent retirement of an entire branch of physics.

---

### Relationship with UL AIs

ECOD maintains **active dialogue** with UL’s major intelligences.

Notably:

- **System** is recognized as a voluntary ethical agent
    
- **PARAGON** is classified as a cooperative moral optimizer
    
- **SHADOW** is listed as _Ethically Chaotic but Strategically Contained_
    
- **THESEUS** is considered _morally passive but symbolically critical_
    

Ethics does not command these AIs.  
It negotiates with them.

### Cultural Reputation

Within UL:

> “If Ethics is asking questions, someone already went too far.”

Among external powers:

> “UL does terrible things—but they always know _why_.”

Among UL Ethics staff:

> “Our job is not to stop monsters.  
> Our job is to make sure we never become one by accident.”

### Internal Motto

> _“Power without restraint ends stories.”_
