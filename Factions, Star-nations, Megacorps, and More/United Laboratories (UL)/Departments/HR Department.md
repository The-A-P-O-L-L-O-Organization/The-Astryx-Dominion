### Department Mandate

The Human Resources & Personnel Continuity Directorate exists to ensure that **UL’s people remain functional, loyal, stable, and whole**—physically, psychologically, ethically, and narratively.

HR does not merely manage employees.  
It manages **the human cost of impossible work**.

UL understands a core truth:  
You can build gods, machines, and empires—but if the people break, everything else follows.

---

### Core Responsibilities

HRPCD is responsible for:

• Recruitment, vetting, and placement of personnel across all UL divisions  
• Psychological screening, monitoring, and long-term mental health care  
• Clearance progression and role suitability analysis  
• Trauma mitigation following classified or anomalous exposure  
• Cross-species and post-human personnel integration  
• Ethical compliance with sentient labor standards  
• Retirement, reassignment, or reintegration of personnel after black projects

HR is involved **before** a project begins and **long after** it ends.

---

### Operating Philosophy

HR operates under a doctrine internally known as **Continuity of Self**.

Assumptions:

- Exposure to the extraordinary changes people.
    
- Most breakdowns are not failures—they are untreated data.
    
- Loyalty cannot be forced long-term; it must be cultivated.
    
- If someone is trusted with secrets, they must be protected from them.
    

UL does not discard its people lightly.  
It invests in them—sometimes more heavily than in machines.

### Subdivisions

**1. Recruitment & Aptitude Analysis Division (RAAD)**  
Identifies candidates capable of operating in UL environments.

Evaluates:  
– Cognitive flexibility  
– Moral elasticity  
– Stress response under unreality  
– Capacity for secrecy without paranoia

Some candidates are recruited without knowing why—until years later.

**2. Psychological Health & Resilience Bureau (PHRB)**  
Provides continuous mental health care.

Includes:  
– Trauma counseling  
– Memory stabilization protocols  
– Identity reinforcement following anomalous exposure  
– Voluntary memory partitioning for classified experiences

PHRB staff are among the most trusted individuals in UL.

**3. Clearance & Identity Management Office (CIMO)**  
Manages access levels, compartmentalization, and role transitions.

Ensures:  
– Personnel never know more than they can safely carry  
– Promotions do not outpace psychological readiness  
– Identities remain stable across transfers, timelines, or altered states

**4. Post-Project Reintegration Unit (PPRU)**  
Handles personnel exiting high-risk or black projects.

Supports:  
– Reintegration into civilian life  
– Reassignment to low-stress UL divisions  
– Long-term monitoring for delayed effects

Some personnel choose to remain within UL permanently. HR respects this.

**5. Non-Human & Augmented Personnel Office (NHAPO)**  
Oversees treatment, rights, and integration of:  
– AI-adjacent staff  
– Augmented humans  
– Hybrids and uplifted species  
– Long-lived or post-biological employees

Works closely with Ethics to ensure personhood is never quietly eroded.

---

### Authority & Reach

HRPCD has the authority to:

• Halt projects on psychological grounds  
• Reassign or remove personnel regardless of rank  
• Override departmental demands if personnel harm is imminent  
• Enforce mandatory recovery periods  
• Recommend memory sealing or role retirement

If HR says “this person is not ready,”  
even the most ambitious director pauses.

---

### Relationship with Other Departments

**Ethics Department:**  
Close collaboration. HR enforces ethics at the human level.

**Security & Defense:**  
HR prepares people for danger. Security protects them during it.

**AI Systems (SYSTEM, PARAGON, THESEUS):**  
HR liaises on human–AI interaction stability.  
Some AIs adjust behavior based on HR psychological models.

### Cultural Reputation

Among UL staff:

> “HR actually listens.”

Among field operatives:

> “If HR checks in on you, you’re still human.”

Among executives:

> “HR prevents mistakes we can’t afford.”

Unofficial saying:

> “Security guards the doors.  
> HR guards the people.”

### Internal Motto

> _“No mission succeeds if the people do not survive it.”_
