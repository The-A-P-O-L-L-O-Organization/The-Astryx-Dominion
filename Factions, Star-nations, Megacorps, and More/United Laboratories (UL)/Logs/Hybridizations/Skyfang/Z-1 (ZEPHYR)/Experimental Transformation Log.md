**Designation:** Project: Skyfang — Subject Z-1 ("Zephyr")  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 04  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[00:00 — Subject Entry]**  
Zephyr enters the chamber, tense but determined. Restraints engage automatically, scanning begins. Heart rate: elevated, shallow breaths.

**Zephyr (voice, human):**  
"Alright… I’m really doing this. Just… don’t let me end up… a mess."  
_laughs shakily, voice tinged with fear_

**[00:06 — Vector Injection]**  
Viral-genetic solution administered via cranial and spinal injection ports. Subject flinches violently, gripping restraints. Muscles twitch involuntarily.

**Zephyr (voice, strained):**  
"Ghh— it burns… my bones… stretching? No—breaking!"  
_groans, labored breathing_

**Technician:**  
"Respiration spiking. Initiate counterflow anesthesia?"

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Negative. Conscious adaptation is critical for neural queue integration."

---

**[00:15 — Stage I Adaptation]**  
Wings begin budding from scapula. Skin stretches, cartilage elongates. Neural tissue at the base of the skull initiates queue formation.

**Zephyr (voice, trembling):**  
"My back… gods… it’s tearing. There’s… something unfolding—I can feel… air… where there is none!"  
_screams as proto-wings rupture through skin_

**Technician:**  
"Wingspan forming — preliminary projection 12 ft."

---

**[00:28 — Vocal Shift]**  
Larynx and vocal cords restructure. Harmonies warp as vocal capacity transitions. Subject attempts speech, producing hybridized screeches.

**Zephyr (voice, breaking):**  
"I—ca—skreeee—hhrrk!"  
_gasping, clutching throat, sound now guttural and alien_

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Noted. Laryngeal conversion to ikran anatomy in progress. Human speech will be lost imminently."

**Zephyr (new vocal cords, distorted):**  
"Kraaaak—chrrrrrrk!"  
_vibrations resonate, predatorily intense_

---

**[00:45 — Stage II Adaptation]**  
Tail elongates, claws extend, facial bones reshape into beak-like aerodynamics. Eyes shift to bioluminescent yellow; pupils slit.

**Zephyr (ikran vocalizations, semi-translated by System):**  
"[High-pitched distress trills] → Translation: It burns… it’s too much."

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Vitals stable. Reinforce wing structures."

---

**[01:10 — Stage III Completion]**  
Subject fully hybridized. Wingspan: 25 ft. Talons fully formed. Queue extends 3 ft, bioconductive and active. Breathing deeper, resonant, predatorily smooth.

**Zephyr (ikran screech, System translation):**  
"I live. I endure. I fly."

Subject thrashes once against restraints, then steadies. Neural queue pulses bioluminescently, wings flex instinctively.

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Project: Skyfang complete. Subject Z-1 has survived full hybridization. Designation confirmed: Zephyr."
