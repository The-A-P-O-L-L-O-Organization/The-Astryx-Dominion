**Designation:** Project: Skyfang — Subject Z-1 ("Zephyr")  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 04 — Containment Observation Wing  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[03:00 — Early Containment Period]**  
Subject Z-1 remains in containment after full hybridization. Wings folded, tail coiled, eyes flicking rapidly. Neural queue pulses irregularly, indicative of heightened stress.

**Technician:**  
"Subject appears hypervigilant. Tail whip frequency at 45% above baseline. Recalibration advised."

**Lead Scientist (off-record, observing):**  
"Good. Let’s see how he reacts to discomfort. It’ll be instructive for behavior profiling."

---

**[03:05 — Experiment: Sensory Overload]**  
Chamber lights shift unpredictably. High-frequency sounds and water-mist bursts activated. Subject thrashes violently, wings flaring, talons scraping floor.

**Zephyr (ikran vocalizations, Theseus translation):**  
"[Screeches and growls] → Translation: Stop! Pain! I hate this! Why?!"

**Technician (chuckling):**  
"His neural queue is spiking. Notice the fight response—excellent data for aggression calibration."

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Keep it brief. Observe imprinting effects. Document every thrash."

**Observation Notes:**
- Subject attempts flight but chamber restrictions prevent escape.
- Vocalizations increasingly guttural, predatory, and incomprehensible to human ears without AI translation.
- Queue emits high-amplitude pulses during stress, signaling severe neural activation.

**[03:12 — Experiment: Social Deprivation & Manipulation]**  
Scientists present holographic images of other hybrid subjects and humans, alternating between friendly gestures and hostile actions. Subject Z-1 exhibits extreme distrust.

**Zephyr (ikran vocalizations, Theseus translation):**  
"[Chittering, low rumble] → Translation: Cannot trust. They hurt. All hurt me. Leave me alone."

**Technician:**  
"Notice the pattern. Aggression is increasing. Fear imprinting taking hold. Excellent for defensive behavior modeling."

**Lead Scientist:**  
"He’s learning quickly—fight first, question later. Exactly what we wanted in a Skyfang operative."

---

**[03:20 — Neural Queue Response]**  
Queue pulses synchronize with stress triggers. Bioluminescent filaments flare irregularly, indicating emotional imprinting. Subject attempts to lash out at nearby chamber walls and instruments.

**Zephyr (ikran vocalizations, Theseus translation):**  
"[Screeching, high-pitched] → Translation: No! Do not touch me! I bite! I strike! Never again!"

**Observation Notes:**
- Aggression metrics exceed projected thresholds for post-hybridization subjects.
- Neural queue response indicates deep-seated distrust and heightened protective instincts.
- Subject now exhibits preemptive defensive posturing, wings partially unfurled, claws ready.

**[03:30 — Scientist Interaction Attempt]**  
Lead Scientist approaches, issuing commands and attempting to calm the subject. Subject immediately rears back, vocalizing a warning.

**Zephyr (ikran vocalizations, Theseus translation):**  
"[Deep growl, trill] → Translation: Do not come closer. You are not safe. I remember."

**Lead Scientist (recording notes):**  
"Note: Memory of human identity suppressed in favor of predator-driven defense mechanisms. Prior human trauma amplified aggression post-transformation."

**Technician:**  
"His reactions are consistent with imprinting from prior unethical treatment. Extreme distrust of humans and forced interaction remains dominant."

---

**[03:45 — Behavioral Conclusion]**  
Subject remains isolated, wings tucked but tail flicking. Neural queue emits low, steady pulses — a sign of residual stress modulation. Aggression toward humans and authority figures remains high; interactions with other hybrids show cautious curiosity.

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Conclusion: Subject Z-1’s aggressive tendencies are not merely instinctual—they are compounded by prior mistreatment. Training and socialization will be necessary for safe operational deployment."

**Observation Notes:**

- Zephyr displays clear memory of cruelty, encoded into neural queue activity.
- Vocalizations suggest deep-seated resentment and defensive reflexes.
- Cooperation with humans will require extended trust-building or alternate liaison via AI interface (Theseus).
