**United Laboratories — Experimental Transformation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: Cerebrum Ascendant — Subject C-1  
**Location:** UL Cognitive Enhancement Chamber 11  
**Recording Medium:** Neural Capture & Video

---

### **[00:00 — Subject Entry]**

C-1 enters the chamber, visibly anxious but compliant. Neuro-stabilization restraints engage. Baseline cognitive and neurological scans initiated.

**C-1 (voice):**  
"I… I understand the procedure, but I’m not sure what this will feel like… hope I don’t lose my mind."  
_Breathes shakily; eyes dart around the chamber._

### **[00:05 — Vector Injection]**

Cranial micro-infusion begins, viral-genetic solution enters bloodstream. Subject flinches as intracranial pressure rises.

**C-1 (voice, strained):**  
"Ghh— my head… it’s like it’s… expanding… everything is… too fast…"  
_Grabs sides of head, knees buckle slightly._

**Technician:**  
“Neural load spiking. Initiating mild counterflow to mitigate overload.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“No— let the synaptic expansion proceed. Full integration requires conscious processing.”

---

### **[00:15 — Stage I Adaptation]**

Synaptic density increases rapidly. Subject experiences sensory and perceptual heightening.

**C-1 (voice, panicked):**  
"I can… see patterns… colors… sounds… it’s all… together… too much!"  
_Eyes wide, trembling, occasionally muttering numbers and equations incoherently._

**Technician:**  
“Subject showing signs of hyper-sensory integration. Monitor for neural overload.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Expected. Allow brain to adapt— discomfort is part of full cognitive augmentation.”

---

### **[00:35 — Stage II Adaptation]**

Neural clusters reorganize; memory and reasoning accelerate. Headaches and visual distortions peak.

**C-1 (voice, strained, almost whispering):**  
"I… I… can predict… sequences… outcomes… multiple possibilities… I can… think… faster than… time itself…"  
_Hands tremble as subject scribbles complex formulae mid-thought._

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Subject demonstrates exponential cognitive increase. Vital signs stable; pain tolerance high.”

---

### **[00:50 — Stage III Completion]**

Cognitive augmentation reaches peak. Subject demonstrates near-instant problem-solving, advanced pattern recognition, and intuitive reasoning.

**C-1 (voice, calm, controlled):**  
"It… it’s done. I can comprehend things I never imagined. My mind… it stretches across ideas, across potentialities. I understand probability… I understand causality… I understand myself."  
_Subject sits upright, serene. Neural interface shows stable, accelerated brain activity._

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Project: Cerebrum Ascendant successful. Subject C-1 fully augmented; cognitive capacity increased thousands of percent.”

### **Post-Transformation Observations**

- Subject adapts quickly to new cognitive load.
    
- Emotional regulation stable despite hyper-awareness.
    
- Begins assisting technicians in real-time analysis, exceeding normal human capabilities.
    
- Subject shows curiosity about ethical implications and potential applications of their enhanced intellect.
