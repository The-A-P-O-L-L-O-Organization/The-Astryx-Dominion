**United Laboratories — Experimental Transformation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: Skyrend — Subject A-3 ("Aerith")  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 07  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[00:00 — Subject Entry]**  
Aerith enters the chamber, eyes wide with anxiety. Restraints engage, sensors sweep over body. Heart rate: elevated.

**Aerith (voice, human):**  
"I… I don’t even know what’s going to happen. Please… just don’t—don’t hurt me too badly."  
_shaky breath, clutches restraints_

**[00:05 — Vector Injection]**  
Viral-genetic solution administered via spinal and cranial injection ports. Subject jerks, gasps sharply. Musculature begins contracting involuntarily.

**Aerith (voice):**  
"Ahhh—my back… my shoulders! It’s… it’s ripping!"  
_groans, panting_

**Technician:**  
"Musculature tension spiking. Wing buds appearing."

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Monitor. Subject must remain conscious for neural integration."

**[00:12 — Stage I Adaptation]**  
Scapula expands; proto-wings begin forming beneath skin. Muscles tear slightly as skeletal plates adjust.

**Aerith (voice, strained):**  
"It’s… it’s like my bones are splitting. Something’s… pushing out of me!"  
_screams, skin stretching noises audible_

**Technician:**  
"Wingspan initial projection: 1.8 meters. Bone structure adapting."

**[00:20 — Sensory Adaptation]**  
Eyes elongate subtly; retina adjusts for long-range vision. Lungs and heart intensify oxygen processing.

**Aerith (voice, shaky):**  
"I—can see… so far… too far… everything’s huge!"  
_gasping, disoriented_

**[00:30 — Stage II Adaptation]**  
Feathers erupt from wing structures, tail feathers emerge for stabilization. Talons form on hands and feet. Neural networks integrate flight balance.

**Aerith (voice, breaking):**  
"My… my fingers… they’re claws! My legs… my tail! I—what’s happening to me?!"  
_panic, screams muffled by gag reflex, slight sobbing_

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Neural integration proceeding. Flight instinct wiring in progress. Ensure subject remains conscious."

**[00:45 — Stage III Completion]**  
Wings fully functional; aerodynamic form complete. Tail feathers extended for steering. Subject stabilizes breathing, heart rate normalizes.

**Aerith (avian hybrid vocalization, Theseus AI translation):**  
"_Krrreee-shhh!_ → I survived. I… I am flying."

**Observation:**  
Aerith thrashes initially but finds equilibrium. Subject displays early attempts at gliding in chamber-simulated wind tunnels.

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Project: Skyrend successful. Subject A-3 fully hybridized. Initial flight tests scheduled under controlled airspace conditions."
