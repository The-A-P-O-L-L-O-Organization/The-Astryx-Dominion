### **UL Personnel Transformation Transcript — Subject: Sebastian**

**Facility:** HADAL Sub-Menagerie Alpha-12  
**Date:** 87 P.G., Arc 6, Cycle 23  
**Experiment Lead:** Dr. Ilyana Vortrek

**[00:00]**  
**Dr. Vortrek:** “Subject awake and stable. Initiating initial serum infusion. Targeting aquatically adaptive physiology. No immediate adverse reactions expected.”

**Sebastian:** “Ugh… what is this? Where am I?”

**[00:05]**  
**Researcher 2:** “Infusion complete. Monitoring vitals. Subject shows mild agitation. Heart rate elevated by 12 BPM.”

**Sebastian:** “Why am I strapped to this… thing? You can’t do this to me!”

**Dr. Vortrek:** “Calm. Resistance expected. Adaptation is part of the process. Subject will stabilize as the mutagen takes hold.”

**[00:15]**  
**Observation Note:** “Early onset of dermal transformation. Light blue scales forming along dorsal spine and arms. Sensory appendages beginning development around temporal region.”

**Sebastian:** “Scales? Something’s… something’s happening to my skin. Stop! It burns!”

**[00:22]**  
**Dr. Vortrek:** “Pain threshold within expected parameters. Analgesics withheld to test neuro-adaptive response. Note: subject vocalization increasing, possible emotional destabilization.”

**Sebastian:** “I… I can feel my arms… shifting… one of them… my left… it’s twisting!”

**Researcher 2:** “Confirming lateral appendage elongation. Formation of pre-fin structures. Claw differentiation beginning.”

**[00:35]**  
**Sebastian:** “No… my hands! My fingers… they’re… longer, clawed!”

**Dr. Vortrek:** “Fingers elongating as per morphogenic template. Four digits retained. Prehensile musculature developing. Third ocular organ forming—temporal side.”

**[00:42]**  
**Sebastian:** “A third… eye? I… I see… everything differently… the water, the light… you’re changing me into something… unnatural!”

**Observation Note:** “Anglerfish esca developing on frontal cranium. Fin-like auricular structures emerging. Tail elongation evident. Subject showing marked increase in neural plasticity, aggressive cognitive adaptation.”

**[00:55]**  
**Sebastian:** “My… tail… it’s heavy, strong… pouches… they feel like they have… things in them…”

**Dr. Vortrek:** “Tail fins forming. End appendage specialization for storage of environmental tools and reagents. Behavioral adaptation to resource acquisition expected. Note heightened irritability.”

**[01:10]**  
**Sebastian:** “I… I don’t feel human anymore… you’re turning me into a… a predator… a weapon!”

**Researcher 2:** “Neural overlay complete. Subject aggression elevated. Subject shows high problem-solving capability. Increased synaptic efficiency noted.”

**[01:25]**  
**Dr. Vortrek:** “Mutation stable. Physical template achieved: elongated serpentine body, three functional arms, clawed digits, tail fin, secondary sensory eye, cranial esca, dermal coloration consistent with deep-water camouflage.”

**Sebastian:** (panting, voice hoarse) “You… you’ve broken me… but I… I’ll… survive this. You’ll pay… someday…”

**Observation Note:** “Subject exhibits acute self-preservation instinct. High likelihood of retaliatory behavior once released or freed. Recommended containment measures updated. Subject exhibits personality persistence, though filtered through aquatic predatory traits.”

**[01:40]**  
**Dr. Vortrek:** “Session concluded. Subject stabilized. Feeding tube connected. Neural feedback loop engaged for cognitive monitoring. Schedule next phase—behavioral conditioning and market-assist specialization.”

**Sebastian:** (muted under sedation) “I… I’ll find a way… you don’t… own me…”
