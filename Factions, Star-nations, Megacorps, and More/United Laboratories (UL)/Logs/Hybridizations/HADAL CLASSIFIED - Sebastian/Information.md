# **UL Personnel Dossier — Subject: SEBASTIAN**

**Acquisition Date:** ████████  
**Department:** HADAL / Mutagenic Adaptation Wing  
**Clearance Level:** INTERNAL – CLASSIFIED  
**Status:** _Active Experimental Asset_

## **Biological Overview**

**Designation:** _Specimen HN-7 “Sebastian”_  
**Original Species:** Human (baseline)  
**Current Category:** Amphibious/Serpentine Hybrid – Deep Variant  
**Contamination Index:** 0.94 (Critical)  
**Mutation Origin:** ABYSSAL SERPENTIS

## **Appearance**

Subject HN-7 displays an elongated, serpentine body plan approximately 3.7 meters in length, coated in smooth, light-blue dermal scales exhibiting mild bioluminescence under low light. Caudal region terminates in a broad, aquatic fin structure supported by two stabilizing dorsal fins, allowing efficient maneuverability in flooded test chambers.

Three arms are present. Two standard primary upper limbs remain fully functional. A tertiary limb has formed along the left lateral thoracic region; limb remains structurally viable despite chronic tissue damage. Subject self-bandages limb regularly; attempts by staff to replace bandages are met with aggression.

Digit structure resembles modified human hands, though each hand possesses four elongated, keratinized claws. Subject reports the digit reduction as “intentional” or “aesthetic,” though UL has no record of voluntary morphological input.

Craniofacial structure retains approximate human proportions with extensive piscine adaptation. Notable modifications include:

- _Anglerfish-style esca_ positioned at forehead ridge; light-producing organ is functional.
    
- _Lateral fin-like structures_ replacing external ears; sensitive to vibrations and water pressure changes.
    
- _Extended mandibular structure_ with flexible cartilage plates enabling widened bite radius.
    
- _Tertiary optical organ_ positioned on right side of face; visually functional with infrared sensitivity.
    
- _Hair:_ retains black, short, wavy human hair anomalously unaffected by transformation.
    
- _Pigmentation:_ fin edges and claws show dark gradient, possibly stress-induced melanization.
    

Overall, subject presents stable hybrid physiology with high combat capability and significant environmental adaptability.

## **Behavioral Profile**

Subject HN-7 maintains a consistent pattern of sarcasm, hostility toward staff, and unpredictable violent responses under perceived provocation. Psychological analysis identifies:

- Marked resentment toward UL personnel
    
- Elevated predatory instincts in submerged environments
    
- Strong self-preservation drive
    
- Selective, transactional empathy
    

Despite antagonism toward UL, subject is capable of cooperation when incentivized. Displays unexpected deference and respect toward individuals who provide assistance, resources, or autonomy. This behavior has been noted as exploitable.

Subject exhibits a notable indifference to other experimental assets, often displaying amusement or dismissive commentary regarding casualties or terminated subjects. However, contrary behavior appears when interacting with prisoners or non-UL individuals; subject demonstrates protective tendencies and adopts a merchant-like persona, exchanging supplies for favors or information. Motivation behind this behavioral split remains under review.

HN-7 does not recognize UL field operatives as inherent enemies unless provoked. Instead, he relies on a pragmatic model of mutual benefit. This trait has led to isolated, unsanctioned collaboration events which are currently under internal investigation.

## **Operational Notes**

- Subject has escaped containment ██ times. Recapture typically requires aquatic units.
    
- Subject retains high intelligence and strong spatial awareness. Cannot be underestimated.
    
- Documented willingness to leverage UL personnel injuries for personal bargaining.
    
- Considered a _medium-risk, high-utility_ asset when properly controlled.

## **Recommended Handling Protocol**

**Minimum Requirements:**

- Two US aquatic-adapted security personnel
    
- Pressure-reinforced containment cell
    
- No unarmored staff permitted within 5 meters
    
- Avoid direct questioning regarding transformation process
    
- Do not reference family, pre-UL identity, or the HADAL program’s ethics
    

Failure to follow protocols results in predictable aggression.
