**United Laboratories — Experimental Transformation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: _Cauda Apex_ — Subject C-9  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 11  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[00:00 — Subject Entry]**  
Subject C-9 enters the chamber, visibly anxious. Restraints engage for safety. Heart rate: elevated.

**C-9 (voice, human):**  
"I… I don’t even know what I’m signing up for. They just said ‘enhancement’… that’s it."  
nervous chuckle

**[00:05 — Vector Injection]**  
Targeted viral-genetic construct administered via subcutaneous injection along sacral region. Subject flinches violently.

**C-9 (voice, strained):**  
"Ahh! Wha—what’s happening?! It burns—like my spine is… alive… stretching!"  
grips restraints, breathing rapid and shallow

Technician:  
“Spinal elongation initiated. Early Stage I reaction intense. Neural feedback elevated.”

Lead Scientist:  
“Monitor vitals. Pain is expected. Maintain consciousness for neural integration.”

---

**[00:12 — Stage I Adaptation]**  
Lower vertebrae begin to elongate. Subject experiences intense pressure and tearing sensations.

**C-9 (voice, panicked):**  
"Oh gods… my lower back… it’s—ugh! It feels like it’s splitting apart!"  
screams, twisting against restraints

Technician:  
“Warning: musculoskeletal stress exceeds normal projections.”

**[00:25 — Stage II Adaptation]**  
Tail bud emerges. Skin stretches, fascia and muscles elongate. Nerve fibers integrate. Pain spikes sharply.

**C-9 (voice, screaming):**  
"No… no, something’s… growing… something behind me! It—ugh—it’s huge!"  
thrashes violently

Lead Scientist:  
“Tail forming rapidly. Neural integration ongoing. Subject may be unaware of full extent until visual reveal.”

**[00:40 — Stage III Adaptation]**  
Tail continues growth, reaching **5 meters**. The length is unprecedented and unplanned. Subject’s spine and muscles are under extreme strain.

**C-9 (voice, desperate):**  
“I… I can’t move right… it’s… something’s behind me! Oh gods, it’s too long… too… big!”  
weeping, shivering from pain

Technician:  
“Warning: tail growth exceeded design parameters. Emergency monitoring engaged.”

**[00:55 — Visual Reveal]**  
Subject is allowed to see the full tail for the first time via reflective surface in the chamber.

**C-9 (voice, horrified):**  
“No… no way… that… that’s… MINE?!”  
panic, hyperventilating

Lead Scientist:  
“Subject C-9, your tail is fully integrated. Length: 5 meters. Neural and muscular control confirmed.”

**C-9 (voice, shaking):**  
“This… this can’t be… I… how am I supposed to live like this?! It’s… monstrous!”  
clutches restraints, tail twitching uncontrollably

---

**[01:10 — Stage IV Stabilization]**  
Neural integration completes. Tail movement is smooth but subject remains extremely distressed. Pain subsides to persistent soreness.

**C-9 (voice, trembling):**  
“I… I don’t know if I can… get used to this. It… it’s part of me now, but… it’s so… so long…”

Lead Scientist:  
“Monitor for adaptation and psychological impact. Tail fully functional and prehensile. Training to begin immediately.”

---

**Notes:**

- Tail growth far exceeded expected parameters, likely due to unanticipated viral-genetic amplification.
    
- Subject remains cognitively intact but exhibits severe emotional distress.
    
- Immediate counseling and gradual training recommended to prevent psychological breakdown.
    
- Contingency protocols for extreme tail lengths implemented.
