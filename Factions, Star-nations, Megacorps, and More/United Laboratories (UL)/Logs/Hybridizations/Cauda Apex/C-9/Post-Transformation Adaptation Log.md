**United Laboratories — Post-Transformation Adaptation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: _Cauda Apex_ — Subject C-9  
**Location:** UL Controlled Living Quarters, Adaptive Training Wing  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[Day 1 — Initial Attempts]**

C-9 attempts to stand and walk normally. Tail drags across floor, knocking over equipment and bumping walls.

**C-9 (voice, frustrated):**  
"Ugh… this thing… it’s like a monster just sprouting from me! I can’t even get through the doorway!"

Technician:  
“Advisable: use prehensile training exercises before full mobility. Tail is reactive but untrained.”

C-9 tries curling the tail around a chair for support, nearly toppling herself.

**C-9 (voice, exasperated):**  
"Okay… okay… maybe I _can_ control it… a little…"

---

**[Day 3 — Early Mastery Attempts]**

C-9 begins practicing precise movements. Tail coils around objects to lift or stabilize herself. Small victories improve morale.

**C-9 (voice, cautious optimism):**  
"Alright… it’s heavy… but I can… lift things with it. Maybe it’s… not _completely_ awful."

Trainer:  
“Good. Neural-muscular integration is progressing. Tail reflexes are improving.”

C-9 accidentally flings a mug across the room.

**C-9 (voice, embarrassed laughter):**  
"Okay… maybe still too powerful."

**[Day 7 — Daily Life Integration]**

C-9 can now navigate hallways, open doors, and pick up objects with her tail. Prehensile function is near full capacity.

**C-9 (voice, tentative satisfaction):**  
"I… can… hold my coffee… and open the drawer… at the same time. I… I think I’m actually… getting used to this."

Technician:  
“Excellent progress. Cognitive functions remain intact; emotional distress has reduced. Tail dexterity now allows multitasking previously impossible.”

C-9 accidentally flicks a pen across the room with the tail, laughing.

**C-9 (voice, genuine amusement):**  
"Okay, okay… now _that_ is kind of fun."

---

**[Day 14 — Adaptation Complete]**

C-9 has achieved full control over the tail. Can perform complex tasks, balance herself in confined areas, and manipulate objects with precision. Psychological evaluation indicates improved acceptance.

**C-9 (voice, relieved):**  
"I… I can’t believe it… I really _am_ managing. It’s still… weird… but… I can live with this."

Lead Scientist:  
“Subject C-9 demonstrates full prehensile tail functionality. Daily life adaptation successful. Recommend beginning advanced task training and potential tactical applications.”

**Notes:**

- Tail remains 5 meters, fully integrated with musculature and neural pathways.
    
- Subject exhibits resilience and adaptive intelligence despite initial extreme distress.
    
- Prehensile skills now exceed baseline predictions.
    
- Psychological support will continue periodically to ensure long-term adjustment.
