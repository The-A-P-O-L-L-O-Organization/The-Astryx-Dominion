**United Laboratories — Experimental Transformation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: Terraform Strider — Subject T-5  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 12  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

### [00:00 — Subject Entry]

Subject T-5 enters the chamber, smiling nervously. Restraints engage lightly for safety; scanning initiates. Heart rate slightly elevated.

**T-5 (voice, human):**  
“Alright… let’s see what all the fuss is about. I’m ready.”  
laughs softly

**Technician:**  
“Vitals stable. Initiating vector delivery.”

---

### [00:05 — Vector Injection]

Viral-genetic construct administered. Mild warmth spreads from injection sites. Subject flinches briefly.

**T-5 (voice):**  
“Ooh… that tingling… it’s… weird, like my legs are buzzing.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Normal for Stage I musculoskeletal adaptation. Neural integration beginning.”

---

### [00:12 — Stage I Adaptation]

Muscles densify, legs elongate slightly. Skin toughens; small scales appear along spine and tail base.

**T-5 (voice, strained):**  
“My… legs… feel heavier… but… stronger? Yeah, stronger, I think.”  
adjusts posture, breathing quickens

**Technician:**  
“Subject adapting well. Mild discomfort expected; no interventions necessary.”

---

### [00:25 — Stage II Adaptation]

**Tail formation begins.** Prehensile appendage emerges from lower spine. Subject visibly startled, instinctively clutches tail base.

**T-5 (voice, distressed):**  
“W-what is happening?! My… my back! There’s… there’s a tail!”  
squeezes restraints, tail writhes involuntarily

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Tail development complete. Prehensile musculature and nerve integration stabilizing. Neural adaptation allows full control shortly.”

**T-5 (voice, anxious):**  
“Five… five meters? That can’t be right… it’s enormous!”  
hesitates, then slowly tests control

---

### [00:40 — Stage III Completion]

Legs fully strengthened; hooves formed. Tail fully integrated, flexible, and responsive. Posture adjusts to enhanced balance.

**T-5 (voice, relieved):**  
“Okay… wow… I can move it… it’s… actually kind of amazing. I didn’t think I’d be okay with this, but… I am.”  
stands, walks around chamber carefully

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Subject demonstrates excellent proprioception and mobility. Psychological adaptation progressing positively. Public demonstration readiness confirmed.”

---

### [00:50 — Observation & Notes]

- Tail control achieved without further distress.
    
- Cognitive functions remain intact; speech unaffected.
    
- Mild initial discomfort subsided within 30 minutes.
    

**Lead Scientist Notes:**

> Transformation successful. Terraform Strider adaptations integrated safely. Subject exhibits natural resilience, fascination with new physical capabilities, and readiness for public-facing roles in land-based exploration and educational demonstrations.
