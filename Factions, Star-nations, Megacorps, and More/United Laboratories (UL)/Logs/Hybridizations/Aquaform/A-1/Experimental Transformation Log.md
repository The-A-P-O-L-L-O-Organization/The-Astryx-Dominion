**United Laboratories — Experimental Transformation Log**  
**Designation:** Project: Aquaform — Subject A-1  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 12  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[00:00 — Subject Entry]**  
Subject A-1 enters the chamber, pale and nervous. Restraints engage lightly to monitor vitals. Heart rate: elevated, breathing rapid.

**Subject (voice, human):**  
"I… I don’t know what to expect. Just… don’t hurt me too much."  
Nervous laugh, hand trembling.

---

**[00:03 — Vector Injection]**  
Viral-genetic solution administered intravenously. Subject flinches violently, gripping restraints. Muscles tense.

**Subject (voice):**  
"Ahhh— it’s… burning… it’s like my throat… and my spine… my chest—"  
Gasping, clutching neck and torso.

**Technician:**  
"Respiration elevated. Pain response intense."

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Continue monitoring. Neural adaptation requires conscious distress for optimal integration."

---

**[00:10 — Stage I Adaptation]**  
Gills begin forming along the neck and rib cage. Subject notices difficulty breathing.

**Subject (voice, panicked):**  
"I— I can’t… my throat… what is happening?!"  
Hands claw at neck, trying to feel the developing gills.

**Technician:**  
"Gill formation progressing. Stress levels extremely high. Continue support."

**Subject:**  
"My chest… it feels… it’s opening… I can feel water in my lungs… but no water!"  
Screaming, body writhing.

---

**[00:20 — Stage II Adaptation]**  
Webbing emerges between fingers and toes; tail begins forming from coccyx. Subject convulses, jerking arms and legs.

**Subject (voice, screaming):**  
"NO! My hands… my feet… it’s… stretching! My—my tail—oh gods!"  
Attempts to curl up, terrified of the emerging 1.2-meter tail.

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Tail growth observed. Neural integration proceeding. Maintain restraints; physical trauma minimized."

**Subject (voice, sobbing):**  
"I… I can’t—move—everything feels… wrong! Why—why me?!"

---

**[00:35 — Stage III Adaptation]**  
Full gill function, tail ~1.8 meters, webbed hands and feet. Skin smooths for hydrodynamics. Eyes adapt to low-light vision.

**Subject (voice, distressed but quieter):**  
"My… my tail… I see it… it’s me… it’s part of me now…"  
Slowly breathes through gills, tasting water molecules in the air.

**Technician:**  
"Subject stabilized. Neurological activity normalizing. Bioluminescence pattern forming."

**Subject (voice, tremulous but aware):**  
"It hurts… it’s… scary… but I… I can breathe. I… I can… move."  
Begins tentative swimming motions in shallow water basin.

---

**[00:50 — Stage IV Completion]**  
Subject fully integrated. Neural adaptation allows control over aquatic movements. Tail and webbing fully functional. Stress levels declining.

**Lead Scientist:**  
"Project: Aquaform successful. Subject A-1 has survived full hybridization. Further training required for comfort in aquatic environments."

**Subject (breathing through gills, voice shaking):**  
"I… I survived… I can move… I can… live in water…"
