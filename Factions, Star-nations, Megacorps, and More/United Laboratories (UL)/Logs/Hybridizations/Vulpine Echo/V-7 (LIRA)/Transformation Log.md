**Designation:** Project: Vulpine Echo — Subject V-7 (“Lira”)  
**Location:** UL Hybridization Chamber 03  
**Recording Medium:** Audio-Visual, Neural Capture

---

**[00:00 — Subject Entry]**  
Subject V-7 enters the chamber under observation. Elevated adrenaline levels, eyes scanning walls as containment seals engage. Heart rate: 110 BPM.  
Voice calm but tense.

**Lira (voice, human):**  
“So this is it… stealth evolution. Don’t make me regret volunteering.”

**Technician:**  
“Neural stabilizer calibrated. Begin sequence on your command.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Proceed. Let the vector in.”

---

**[00:04 — Vector Injection]**  
Viral-genetic solution administered intravenously. Bio-nanites begin synchronizing with Lira’s genome. Light tremors observed.

**Lira (voice, strained):**  
“Feels like… static in my veins… spreading fast.”  
_gasps, clutching arm_

**Technician:**  
“Subject temperature rising — two degrees and climbing.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Expected. Cellular re-patterning at the dermal layer commencing.”

---

**[00:08 — Stage I: Neural & Muscular Adaptation]**  
Reflex pathways re-align. Myofibril density increases by 18%. Subject’s pupils contract; hearing sensitivity spikes.

**Lira (voice, uneasy):**  
“I can hear… your heartbeat… all of you. It’s loud.”  
_shudders_ “Everything’s so bright.”

**Technician:**  
“Photoreceptor recalibration active. Transitioning to low-light optimization.”

Fine fur begins forming along forearms and collar. Fingernails darken, curving subtly.

---

**[00:17 — Stage II: Vulpine Morphogenesis]**  
Spinal structure elongates; coccygeal vertebrae replicate. Tail growth initiates. Ears restructure, cartilage reforming into high-sensitivity vulpine shapes.

**Lira (voice, gasping):**  
“My back—! It’s pushing out— gods—”  
_strained cry as tail extends_

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Tail length stabilizing at 90 cm. Neural conduction in new appendage functional.”

**Technician:**  
“Ears responsive. Subject tracking every ambient sound source. Hyper-acuity confirmed.”

---

**[00:26 — Cognitive Shift]**  
Neural storm detected — dual-pattern consciousness emerging. Lira’s speech fragments.

**Lira (voice, wavering):**  
“I feel … hungry for motion. Like I could run through walls.”  
_laughs sharply, feral tone slipping in_ “Or past them, without being seen.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Predatory cognition surfacing. Maintain vocal check-ins.”

**Lira:**  
“You sound slow to me.”  
_smiles, teeth sharpening_

---

**[00:35 — Stage III: Full Hybridization]**  
Fur growth complete — dense russet-silver coat. Limb joints realign for digitigrade stance. Nails fully transform into retractable claws.

Oxygen efficiency rises +22%; resting heart rate stabilizes at 72 BPM.

**Lira (voice, partially altered):**  
“Everything feels light. I can smell the coolant from here. Every pulse in this room — yours, mine — I could count them.”

**Technician:**  
“Subject vocal timbre shifting — registers between human alto and vulpine resonance.”

**Lira (grinning):**  
“Cute trick, right? You’ll never hear me coming next time.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Hybridization stabilized. Confirm Override implant handshake.”

**Technician:**  
“Confirmed. Neural link secure. Queue response within expected parameters.”

---

**[00:44 — Behavioral Evaluation]**  
Subject freed from primary restraints. Instantly drops to crouched stance, balance feline-precise. Flicks tail, head turning in small jerks — scanning air currents.

**Lira (voice, low):**  
“So quiet. Feels right.”

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Engage stealth protocol simulation.”

_Lira blurs; motion capture loses lock for 2.4 seconds._

**Technician:**  
“Contact lost — she’s behind you!”

_Subject reappears calmly beside console, smirking._

**Lira:**  
“Told you. Never hear me coming.”

---

**[00:52 — Completion]**  
Physiology stable. Hybridization rate 100%. Neural integration complete.

**Lead Scientist:**  
“Designation confirmed. Subject V-7 — ‘Lira’.  
Project Vulpine Echo: Phase I transformation successful.”

**System (log annotation):**  
_Hybrid displays high situational awareness, extreme stealth aptitude, and intact higher cognition. Behavioral drift toward playful aggression noted. Continued observation required._
