**United Laboratories — Post-Transformation Observation**  
**Project:** Sirenia Shift
**Subject:** H-124  (Female)
**Date:** 0825-T16:10  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Lyrin Valen

---

**Testing Chamber:** Large aquatic environment, simulating coastal and shallow ocean habitats.

**Objective:** Observe subject’s natural behavior, swimming adaptation, and psychological response in a controlled but unrestricted aquatic setting.

---

**16:15 — Initial Release**

- Subject enters water tentatively, tail dragging slightly along the floor before achieving buoyancy.
    
- Webbed hands and feet aid in propulsion.
    

**H-214:** (nervously) “I… I don’t know if I can do this… it’s… too much…”

**Observation:** Initial hesitation noted; physiological systems fully functional; respiration stable via gills and lungs.

---

**16:30 — Exploration**

- Subject begins slow swimming around chamber.
    
- Tail provides fluid movement; maneuvering appears instinctive.
    
- Curiosity starts to override distress, though voice indicates lingering psychological discomfort.
    

**H-214:** (softly) “It’s… strange… but I can move… I can… I guess I can swim…”

**Observation:** Aquatic adaptations perform optimally; no mechanical issues with tail or limbs.

---

**16:50 — Interaction with Environment**

- Subject approaches simulated coral formations and artificial obstacles.
    
- Uses tail for precise turns and webbed hands for exploration.
    
- Exhibits cautious approach, reflecting ongoing psychological adjustment to new body.
    

**H-214:** (murmuring) “I can feel… everything… differently… it’s… overwhelming… but… not unbearable…”

**Observation:** Sensory enhancements fully active; subject shows increasing agency over movement.

---

**17:30 — Behavior & Psychological Notes**

- Subject begins tentative vocalizations adapted to female phenotype.
    
- Observers note moments of tension when performing maneuvers requiring complex tail use, but no panic observed.
    
- Subject shows willingness to continue exploration when reassured by supervising staff.
    

**Recommendation:** Continue controlled free-swimming sessions, gradually increase complexity of environment. Introduce guided tasks to encourage confidence and autonomy while monitoring psychological adaptation.

---

**Summary:**

- Aquatic physiology and adaptations functioning within expected parameters.
    
- Subject remains psychologically distressed over gender modulation but is showing signs of gradual acclimation.
    
- Tail, webbing, and gills fully operational; subject able to navigate chamber independently.
    
- Ongoing monitoring and counseling required to support identity integration and maximize functional capability in aquatic environment.
