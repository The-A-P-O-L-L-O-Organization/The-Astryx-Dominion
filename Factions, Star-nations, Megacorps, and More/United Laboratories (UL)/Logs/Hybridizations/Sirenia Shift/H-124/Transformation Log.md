**United Laboratories — Transformation Log**  
**Project:** Sirenia Shift
**Subject:** H-124 (Male)  
**Date:** 0825-T14:22  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Lyrin Valen

---

**00:00 — Injection/Immersion Initiated**

**H-214:** “W-what’s happening…? I-I don’t feel right…”

**Dr. Valen:** “Remain calm. This is the vector taking effect. You may feel changes physically and hormonally.”

**H-214:** (voice quivering) “I… I feel… strange… everything feels… wrong.”

---

**00:30 — Early Transformation**

- Muscular tension increases, slight skeletal reshaping begins.
    
- Subject experiences nausea and dizziness.
    

**H-214:** “My… my chest… it’s… expanding? This can’t be happening…”  
**Internal Note:** Subject expresses acute distress over feminization. No other physiological distress observed.

---

**01:15 — Mid-Transformation**

- Tail begins to form, vertebral extension noticeable.
    
- Hands and feet starting to web; enhanced aquatic sensory perception active.
    
- Hormonal changes continue; feminization more pronounced.
    

**H-214:** (grasping sides of torso) “No… no… I’m… I’m changing… I don’t want… to… I…”  
**Dr. Valen:** “The gender modulation is an intended effect. Your body is adjusting to aquatic physiology. Focus on breathing.”  
**H-214:** (panting) “I… I feel… trapped in… someone else’s… body…”

---

**02:00 — Advanced Transformation**

- Full aquatic tail has formed; webbing completed.
    
- Gills present; respiration partially adapted for submerged environments.
    
- Skeletal and muscular changes finalized for fluid aquatic movement.
    

**H-214:** (voice cracking) “I… I can’t… this isn’t me… why… why is this happening…”

**Dr. Valen:** “You are still yourself. Adaptation will take time. Psychological integration support will follow immediately.”

---

**02:30 — Stabilization**

- Subject now fully transformed into mermaid physiology.
    
- Vocal cords have adapted; gendered voice aligns with female phenotype.
    
- Subject shows distress primarily over gender change; no physical pain noted beyond initial adjustment.
    

**H-214:** (soft sobbing) “I… I need… time… I… I’m… I’m… someone else…”

**Internal Note:** Subject demonstrates acute psychological distress exclusively tied to gender modulation. Aquatic traits and tail formation cause curiosity but no physical panic. Continuous monitoring required for psychological adaptation.

---

**Post-Transformation Care**

- Subject placed in controlled aquatic environment with therapeutic personnel.
    
- Gradual acclimation exercises for swimming, breathing, and aquatic movement.
    
- One-on-one psychological counseling to reconcile identity and gender changes.
    

---

**Observation Summary:**

- Physiological changes proceeded within expected parameters.
    
- Acute psychological distress over gender modulation observed; no additional physical trauma.
    
- Subject capable of communication and responsive to supportive intervention.
    
- Further long-term monitoring recommended for integration and consent-based adaptation.
