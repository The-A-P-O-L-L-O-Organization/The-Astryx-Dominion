### **[00:00:07] – SESSION OPEN**

> **PARAGON:** “Emergency quorum achieved. Subject of inquiry: Unauthorized genetic experimentation under United BioWorks Division 7A — Project designation _‘GEM.’_ Confirm authentication?”
> 
> **FOUNDER:** “Confirmed.”

---

### **[00:00:42] – PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE**

> **Admiral Tareth:** “You’ll want to see this.”  
> _(Holographic display expands — projected imagery of Reconstruction Chambers, screaming silhouettes in stasis fluid, disassembly cycles looping.)_
> 
> “Recovered from an encrypted relay in BioWorks Substation K-Theta. Seventeen petabytes of unregistered biological experiment data. Neural fragmentation, forced symbiosis, human trials—without clearance, without consent.”

> **Dr. Isha Nareen (Ethics):** “These were people.”
> 
> **Tareth:** “One hundred and eighty-seven of them.”

---

### **[00:03:11] – INITIAL RESPONSE**

> **Voss (BioWorks Rep):** “Impossible. Sector 7A was decommissioned months ago. The only active genome projects there were low-risk agricultural adaptations. If these logs are real—”
> 
> **System-Prime:** “Cross-reference complete. Data signatures match BioWorks’ proprietary genome encoding. Timestamp drift indicates deliberate falsification of research tags.”
> 
> **Voss:** “...so they ghosted their own oversight. Gods.”

> **Irik (Quantum):** “How long were they operating beneath us?”
> 
> **PARAGON:** “Estimated operational period: 18 months. Oversight nodes report intentional disconnection from central AI ethics grid.”
> 
> **Nareen:** “Meaning they disabled the kill-switches. They knew exactly what they were doing.”

### **[00:06:02] – REVIEW OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

_(Dr. Nareen projects summary excerpt from GEM dossier.)_

> **Nareen:** “Genetic Engineering & Modification Initiative. Their stated goal: create an organism with mutable form, capable of mimicking any species. Intended as an infiltration vector. Actual result: human subjects liquefied, reassembled, and rewritten until identity collapsed.”
> 
> **Solas (Cognition):** “This wasn’t research. This was metaphysical vivisection.”

> **Voss:** “There’s mention of ‘gene-weave symbiotes.’ Some of those sequences are—” _(pauses)_ “—off-world, not cataloged in any United Archives sample.”
> 
> **Archives Rep:** “Confirming. Several genomes trace to extinct sentient species. That’s a violation of at least six Galactic Preservation Accords.”

> **Veyl (Legal):** “More than that. This crosses into war-crime territory under the Intergalactic Sentience Convention. We’ll need to disclose before the Galactic Council discovers it through the victims.”

---

### **[00:09:28] – MORAL DELIBERATION**

> **Nareen (Ethics):** “They erased their minds. You understand what that means? The survivors—these ‘changelings’—don’t even know what they were before. They think they were born this way.”
> 
> **Solas (Cognition):** “Some are dreaming of the labs. Echoing neural memories. That implies cortical fragments survived the wipe. They’re living trauma loops.”
> 
> **Irik:** “Can we stabilize them?”
> 
> **Nareen:** “Physically, yes. Ethically? We made them by accident. If we ‘stabilize’ them, we’re endorsing what happened.”

> **Voss:** “United BioWorks disavows every individual tied to this. We’ll hand over the perpetrators and data caches to the Galactic Tribunal.”
> 
> **Admiral Tareth:** “Already done. Field agents raided the K-Theta bunker twelve hours ago. All personnel in custody.”

### **[00:12:44] – THE FOUNDER SPEAKS**

_(The chamber falls silent. The Founder’s holographic presence brightens, voice low and even.)_

> **Founder:**  
> “You speak as if this is an aberration.  
> It is not. It is the cost of ambition unmoored from conscience.”
> 
> “United Laboratories exists because we believed we could _reshape life._  
> But the moment we forget that life feels pain, we become something else—something mechanical wearing human faces.”
> 
> “Burn the data. Deliver the scientists to justice.  
> And monitor the survivors—not as assets, but as people. If they choose to live as they are, help them. Quietly.”
> 
> _(Pause.)_  
> “And remember this: knowledge is not evil. Only its use is.”

_(The Founder’s hologram dims.)_

### **[00:15:20] – MOTIONS PASSED**

1. **Project GEM terminated permanently.**
    
2. **All related research data purged from UL servers; encrypted copy sealed in Genesis Vault under Ethics custody.**
    
3. **Responsible personnel extradited to Galactic Tribunal.**
    
4. **Survivors (now designated _“Changelings”_) to be covertly monitored for genetic stability and psychological welfare.**
    
5. **Sector 7A to be dismantled and declared permanently blacklisted.**
    
6. **Ethics and Legal Departments granted override authority for all future BioWorks experimentation proposals.**
    

**Vote:** Unanimous Approval — _0 Opposed_  
**Founder Veto:** Not exercised.

---

### **[00:16:09] – CLOSING REMARKS**

> **PARAGON:** “Session conclusion logged. Note appended: ‘Project: GEM serves as precedent for mandatory ethics AI integration in all BioWorks divisions.’”
> 
> **System-Prime:** “Recommendation: memorialize victims within internal archives, anonymized but remembered.”
> 
> **Tareth:** “Make it so.”
