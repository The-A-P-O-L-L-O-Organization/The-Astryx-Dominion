**Type:** Cognitive-Signal Containment & Recalibration Directive  
**Clearance Required:** Prime (Founder Only)

**Overview:**  
Protocol Welsh is a UL-wide **thought-signal harmonization protocol** designed to protect the Laboratories from memetic corruption, hostile psionic intrusion, or cascading cognitive drift across networks, hybrids, and personnel. Unlike brute-force lockdowns, Welsh operates by rewriting the _frequency of thought_ within all linked UL systems.

**Core Functions:**
- **Signal Realignment:** All active hybrids, AI cores, and psionic interfaces are forced into harmonic synchronization with UL’s root frequency. Rogue impulses or external influences are neutralized instantly.
- **Mind-Lock Mode:** Personnel may be placed into a temporary cognitive stasis, freezing higher thought processes while maintaining autonomic functions. This prevents manipulation or extraction of sensitive knowledge.
- **Echo Shroud:** All UL transmissions shift into a **linguistic obfuscation layer** — speech, code, and signals are automatically filtered into meaningless static to outsiders.
- **Reset Cascade:** In extreme cases, Welsh can reset entire distributed minds (AI clusters, psionic hybrids) back to their **last confirmed integrity point**, erasing contamination.

**Safeguards:**
- Only activatable by Founder authority or unanimous Prime-Clearance council.
- Cannot be reversed mid-cycle once fully engaged — Welsh runs to completion before systems can resume normal function.
- Override Spear access remains functional, ensuring manual control if automated harmonization fails.
