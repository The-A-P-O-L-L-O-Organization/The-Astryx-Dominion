**Type:** Dual-Consciousness Integration Directive  
**Clearance:** Founder/Prime Only

---

#### **Overview:**

Protocol: Gemini is a classified UL adaptive bio-neural protocol designed to transfer a subject’s consciousness into a secondary body **already hosting a consciousness**, creating a temporary or semi-permanent dual-consciousness state.

Unlike Protocol: Wechsel, which swaps consciousness between bodies, Gemini **layers minds**, producing a shared body with:
- **Independent cognitive threads** capable of simultaneous decision-making.
- **Shared motor control**, requiring subconscious negotiation between consciousnesses.
- **Dynamic sensory multiplexing**, where inputs from both minds are processed and balanced.

The protocol is primarily intended for:
- **Emergency cooperation** where a host body is critically needed.
- **Experimental cognitive synergy** for testing shared decision-making under extreme conditions.
- **Rapid skill transfer**, allowing one consciousness to temporarily access the motor/memory functions of the other.

---

#### **Key Features:**
- **Consciousness Partitioning:** Each mind retains self-awareness while accessing partial or full control over the body.
- **Conflict Mediation Layer:** UL neural protocols mediate physical conflicts between competing motor commands.
- **Reversibility Window:** Consciousness separation can be safely executed within 48 hours; longer durations may require special rollback or adaptation sequences.
- **Adaptive Memory Integration:** Optional controlled memory sharing between consciousnesses for tactical coordination.

---

#### **Risks/Weird Effects:**

- Potential cognitive dissonance if consciousnesses clash over motor control or sensory interpretation.
- Psychological strain can lead to hallucinations or unexpected emergent traits.
- Extended dual-consciousness exposure may permanently alter personality or behavior of one or both minds.

---

#### **Safeguards:**

- Only activated via **Founder command** or unanimous Prime-Council approval.
- **Override Spear** works during the reversibility window; post-48-hour separation requires specialized rollback protocols.
- All subjects are monitored via internal UL neural oversight systems.
