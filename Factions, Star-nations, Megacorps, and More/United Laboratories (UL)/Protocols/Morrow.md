**Type:** Autonomous Adaptive Bio‑Recalibration Directive  
**Clearance:** Founder/Prime Only (real parameters classified)

**Core Mechanism:**
- **Trigger Authority:** Not directly UL leadership. Instead, it’s tied to a _dual‑consensus system_ between **GAIA** (UL’s environmental superintelligence) and **System** (UL’s backend).
- **Hidden Clause:** All UL employee/citizen contracts contain a concealed consent clause authorizing “emergency bio‑adaptive measures.” This legally permits GAIA + System to trigger Morrow at any time without public announcement.

**How It Works:**
- GAIA constantly monitors cosmic conditions, pathogens, alien biofields, and psionic threats.
- If GAIA and System’s biological substrates agree an adaptation is needed, Morrow _automatically initiates_.
- This can happen across a single facility, an entire star system, or even a fleet, rewriting employee biology in seconds.

**Implications:**
- **Spontaneous Transformation:** UL citizens can suddenly gain new limbs, senses, or internal systems tailored to survival.
- **No Advance Warning:** Because the consent clause is hidden, most employees will simply experience the adaptation without understanding why.
- **Post‑Event Realization:** After each activation, GAIA and System log the changes and update the Genesis Vault — but only Prime/Omega‑level clearance sees the real report.
- **Network Symbiosis:** Because Morrow works via UL’s nanomedical grid, transformed groups may temporarily share synaptic links or cooperative instincts.

**Risks / Concerns:**
- **Psychological Disorientation:** Immediate biological changes can cause identity and loyalty stress, even if beneficial.
- **Unpredictable Appearance:** Because Morrow draws on the Pantheon Genome, resulting forms may look alien or “impossible” even if functional.
- **Override Limitations:** The Override Spear works reliably only in the first 48 hours post‑trigger; after that, the individual’s biology is effectively locked.
