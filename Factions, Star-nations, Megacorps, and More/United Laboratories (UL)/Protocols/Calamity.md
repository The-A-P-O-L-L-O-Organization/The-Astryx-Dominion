### **Classification**

- **Clearance**: **Omega Prime only** (Founder-authorization required for full activation).
- **Priority**: Absolute Emergency — supersedes all other standing directives, projects, or operational chains.
- **Triggering Authority**: Founder or designated Omega Prime clearance delegate.

---

### **Purpose**

Protocol: Calamity is UL’s failsafe directive, enacted only in existential crises where:
- UL assets, creations, or subsidiaries are in danger of catastrophic collapse.
- External threats (planetary, stellar, or galactic) exceed projected countermeasures.
- Internal corruption, subversion, or hostile takeover compromises UL control.
- Genesis Galaxy or Omega Aeternum–class projects risk annihilation.

### **Phases**

1. **Containment**
    - Immediate lockdown of **all UL systems**, labs, subsidiaries, and networks.
    - Override spear network escalated to **full-spectrum control mode**, enabling centralized override of **all UL assets** — biological, mechanical, and digital.
    - Isolation of compromised regions/projects with hard signal quarantines.
    
2. **Correction**
    - Deployment of **Calamity Response Units** (CRUs) — specialized hybridized or synthetic constructs designed for mass-scale suppression, reclamation, or purge.
    - All subsidiaries switch from individual directives to **singular UL command hierarchy**.
    - Resource redirection: power, datacenter bandwidth, fabrication capacity focused entirely on crisis mitigation.
    
3. **Continuation**
    - If full restoration is impossible, **Protocol: Calamity** shifts into continuity mode:
        - Core UL databanks (including **United Archives**, Founders’ records, and override schematics) are secured in quantum-encrypted vaults across multiple star systems.
        - Genesis Galaxy seed nodes (birthing-capable micro-Birch Worlds) are deployed to preserve UL’s infrastructure and legacy.
        - AI backup of _System_ and other Omega-tier assistants launched into hidden safe zones.

### **Consequences of Activation**

- Civilian populations in UL jurisdictions are forcibly evacuated or hybridized into survivable forms.
- All United-subsidiaries lose autonomy; UL central command becomes absolute.
- Non-cooperative species, factions, or even UL employees are subject to override or neutralization.
- Activation is permanent — once declared, **Protocol: Calamity cannot be rescinded** except by the Founder.

### **Philosophical Core**

UL views calamity as not merely destruction, but **reset**. Where lesser civilizations collapse under their own weight, UL ensures continuity through dominance, override, and rebirth. The Forge of the Gods, Project Aeonframe, and Genesis Galaxy are all built to withstand or re-seed existence itself — **Protocol: Calamity is the hammer that clears the way.**
