**Type:** Adaptive Biological Exoskeleton Directive  
**Clearance:** Prime / Founder Only for activation; others may access under controlled experimentation

---

### **Overview:**
Protocol: Ecliptic is a **living biological protocol** embedded in select UL employees’ genomes and augmented by nanomedical implants. Its purpose is to allow **instantaneous generation of adaptive defensive exoskeletons**, optimized for the environment, threat type, and mission parameters. Unlike traditional armor, Ecliptic is **fully integrated into the body**, extending from the dermis outward and capable of dynamic reshaping, hardening, or energy modulation.

---

### **Activation Mechanism:**
- **Trigger:** Volitional (employee command) or automated (System/GAIA during emergencies).
- **Latency:**
    - **Stage I (0–3 seconds):** Nanomedical activation signals cascade through dermal and muscular tissues.
    - **Stage II (3–10 seconds):** Exoskeletal scaffolding begins forming; adaptive sensors scan local threats and environment.
    - **Stage III (10–30 seconds):** Full exoskeleton deployed with tailored properties (durability, flexibility, energy absorption).

### **Key Features:**
1. **Adaptive Armor Composition**
    - Hardens or softens dynamically depending on impact force, temperature, radiation, or chemical threats.
    - Can produce energy shielding (plasma, electromagnetic, or kinetic absorption layers).
    
2. **Environmental Integration**
    - Exoskeleton adapts to atmospheric conditions, gravity variations, and radiation levels.
    - Surface can change texture or coloration for camouflage or signaling.
    
3. **Morphological Flexibility**
    - Armor can extend to include retractable wings, claws, or tail reinforcements if advantageous.
    - Flexible sections allow full mobility for combat, flight, swimming, or zero-g operations.
    
4. **Neural-Sensor Coupling**
    - Fully synced to the employee’s nervous system for **reflex-level control**.
    - Provides real-time threat detection and predictive movement adjustments.
    
5. **Emergency Override & Deactivation**
    - System/GAIA can retract exoskeleton instantly in emergencies or for medical access.
    - Exoskeleton automatically deactivates after prolonged inactivity or mission completion to conserve metabolic energy.

### **Risks & Side Effects:**
- Temporary neural overload during rapid adaptation phases.
- Excessive use may cause muscular fatigue or tissue strain.
- Rare cases of unintended hybrid exoskeleton growth if combined with other biological protocols (Morrow, Gemini).

---

### **Tactical Applications:**
- **Personal Defense:** Instant protection in hostile environments or combat zones.
- **High-Risk Missions:** Planetary exploration, alien biosphere interactions, zero-g operations.
- **Hybrid Integration:** Can enhance or reinforce Skyfangs or Omega Form units during joint operations.
