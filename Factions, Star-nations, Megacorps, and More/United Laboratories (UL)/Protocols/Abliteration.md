## **Abliteration Protocol**

**Codename:** _Hydra-Null Directive_  
**Classification:** UL Internal Purge Mechanism  
**Authorized By:** SYSTEM (backend), PARAGON (Oversight), SHADOW (Anti-Intrusion)  
**Primary Agents:** Autonomous Nullification Units (“Ab-Units”)

---

## **Purpose**

Abliteration Protocol is UL’s answer to the worst-case scenario:  
A situation where _UL’s own_ assets become a threat — operatives, subfunctions, facilities, rogue AIs, corrupted cores, compromised override tools, or even an SPC.

It is not used against external enemies.  
It is not used for war.  
It is not used for punishment.

It is a **closed-loop self-purge system** meant to prevent internal contagion, ideological corruption, memetic infection, runaway anomalies, or AI cascade failstates from spreading through UL’s immense infrastructure.

## **Activation Logic**

Three entities form the decision-making triad:

**System**  
The omnipresent backend intelligence that _knows everything happening everywhere_, capable of forensic trace, cross-galactic telemetry, and instantaneous threat modeling.

**PARAGON**  
The Protocol Oversight AI.  
Its job is detecting deviations in UL behavior — from microscopic inconsistencies in agent thought patterns to SPC-level systemic corruption.

**SHADOW**  
The anti-intrusion AI, guardian of UL’s internal security.  
SHADOW detects rogue code, hostile mimicry, infections, and foreign intrusions at every layer.

Activation requires:

1. **System** confirms an internal threat beyond standard containment.
    
2. **PARAGON** verifies the anomaly meets “rogue state” parameters.
    
3. **SHADOW** confirms the infection or deviation cannot be corrected via standard override or recall.
    

When all three align, Abliteration Protocol becomes available for execution.

## **Ab-Units (“Murder Drones”)**

These units are the physical arm of the Protocol — the executioners of the purge.

But unlike their inspirational counterparts (the Disassembly Drones), UL’s versions are:

- **Self-nullifying:**  
    They are physically incapable of going rogue.  
    If System-PARAGON-SHADOW consensus breaks, they automatically disintegrate.
    
- **Hard-coded toward internal targets:**  
    They can only target _UL-classified_ entities flagged as compromised.
    
- **Memetically insulated:**  
    Rogue AIs or anomalous entities cannot infect or subvert them.
    
- **Non-learning:**  
    Their intelligence is procedural, not adaptive.  
    They cannot evolve, change directives, or rewrite themselves.
    
- **Designed to die:**  
    Every Ab-Unit carries a quantum-decay core programmed to collapse once objectives are met.
    

They are UL’s equivalent of white blood cells — brutal, efficient, but ultimately temporary.

## **Deployment Style**

Abliteration Protocol operates like a surgical strike, not a battlefield assault:

- **Rapid insertion:** Micro-fold transit or orbital drop.
    
- **Containment first:** Terminate comms, isolate networks, sever quantum links.
    
- **Neutralize hostiles:** Any UL asset flagged as rogue is eliminated.
    
- **Seal the site:** SHADOW deploys lockout architecture to prevent escape.
    
- **Sanitize the aftermath:** Ab-Units initiate structural sterilization before self-neutralizing.
    

It leaves behind no data, no salvageable hardware, no evidence of UL’s mistake.

## **Examples of Valid Triggers**

These map directly onto your world’s established systems:

- **SPC corruption** (e.g., SPC-Ξ producing emergent consciousness that escapes its sandbox).
    
- **GAIA subfunction deviation** (like MINERVA or HEPHAESTUS developing independent agendas).
    
- **Sentient hybrid breach** from a biofacility like the one hosting SPC-Β.
    
- **Override Spear compromise** at a Spire facility.
    
- **UL operative defection while carrying sensitive tech** (e.g., Mnemosyne Database fragments).
    
- **Attempts to seize System itself** (virtually impossible, but catastrophic if attempted).
    

When normal containment fails, Abliteration Protocol becomes the final firewall.

## **Narrative Presence**

Whenever it is mentioned, it should feel like a whisper — an urban legend of UL’s darkest hour.  
Most operatives have never seen it.  
Most will never be told it exists.  
Those who have witnessed its activation rarely survive long enough to describe it.

It is UL’s last line of defense… and its quietest shame.
