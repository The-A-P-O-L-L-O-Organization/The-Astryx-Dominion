## **1. Division Overview**

**Division Name:** Anomalies Division (AD)  
**Mission Statement:**

> To locate, contain, neutralize, and study anomalies that violate baseline reality. To maintain temporal, spatial, and existential integrity across all UL-controlled domains.

**Mandate:**

- Secure anomalous entities, objects, phenomena, and pocket dimensions.
    
- Study anomalies to advance scientific understanding, defensive capabilities, and controlled application.
    
- Prevent exposure of reality-defying phenomena to unauthorized personnel or external entities.
    

**Special Assets:**

- **SPC-Ψ Core:** Hybrid quantum-bio-analog-digital computational core capable of modeling non-linear spacetime phenomena.
    
- **Mobile Containment Units (MCUs):** Rapid-deployment units for anomaly field capture.
    
- **Temporal & Spatial Monitoring Grid:** Monitors dimensional distortions and temporal deviations in real-time.

## **3. Facilities**

- **Central Containment Complex (CCC):**  
    Modular underground/multidimensional facility with adaptive chambers. Containment chambers are customized for each anomaly. Fully shielded against standard, quantum, and metaphysical interference.
    
- **SPC-Ψ Core Room:**  
    Dedicated anomalous SPC core. Functions partially outside conventional spacetime. Operates as both predictive model and containment interface for reality-defying phenomena.
    
- **Field Operations Bunkers:**  
    Mobile, temporary bases for anomaly acquisition and immediate containment. Equipped with anomaly suppression tech, high-grade AI surveillance, and rapid dimensional relocation capabilities.
    
- **Research Lab Nodes:**  
    High-tech labs for controlled study of anomalies, isolated and shielded with quantum and dimensional dampening fields.

## **5. Known Anomalies Contained**

**Note:** Only a select few anomalies are documented for internal overview. Full anomaly registry classified under Level-Ω.

1. **Object #AD-001:** “Reverse Gravity Sphere”
    
    - Generates a localized gravity inversion field.
        
    - Containment: Dynamic graviton-null chamber.
        
2. **Entity #AD-017:** “Mnemonic Evader”
    
    - Sentient, erases itself from memory upon observation.
        
    - Containment: Temporal stasis chamber with constant external observer AI.
        
3. **Phenomenon #AD-042:** “Pocket Dimension Delta-9”
    
    - Non-linear time, mutable physical laws.
        
    - Containment: Dimensional anchoring array integrated into CCC.
        
4. **Artifact #AD-089:** “Predictive Codex”
    
    - Can foresee short-term future events and influence human behavior.
        
    - Containment: SPC-Ψ monitored, memetic shielding applied.

## **6. Operational Protocols**

- **Anomaly Acquisition:** Rapid deployment MCUs, field risk assessment, multi-level suppression protocols.
    
- **Containment:** Adaptive chamber systems, SPC-Ψ predictive modeling, multi-tiered redundancies.
    
- **Research & Testing:** Controlled exposure, continuous monitoring, ethics oversight mandatory.
    
- **Emergency Breach Response:** Autonomous lockdown, temporal stabilization measures, full-scale SPC-Ψ intervention if necessary.

## **7. Security Clearance**

- Level-Ω required for all operational knowledge beyond public façade.
    
- SPC-Ψ access requires dual-authentication: Director-level override plus Ethics Officer verification.
    
- Unauthorized access results in automated temporal-existential erasure protocols (non-lethal containment of info leak).

## **8. Notes**

- The Anomalies Division is the only UL division capable of interacting safely with phenomena that defy baseline reality.
    
- All AD projects are classified “Reality Integrity Protocol Level 1.” Unauthorized exposure may result in permanent timeline destabilization.
    
- Personnel are monitored continuously by SPC-Ψ for cognitive, psychological, and temporal integrity.
