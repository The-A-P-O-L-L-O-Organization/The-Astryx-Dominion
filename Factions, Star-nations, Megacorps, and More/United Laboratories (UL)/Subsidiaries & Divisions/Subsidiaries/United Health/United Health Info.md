## **United Health (UH) — Corporate Dossier**

**Designation:** United Health (UH)  
**Category:** Healthcare, Medicine, and Biotechnological Services  
**Operational Scope:** Interstellar (Milky Way + Genesis Galaxy)  
**Status:** Active — Fully Integrated into United Laboratories Subsidiary Network

### **Overview**

United Health (UH) is the leading interspecies healthcare and medical research organization under the United Laboratories umbrella. Established to provide universal access to advanced medical treatment and research, UH combines conventional medicine, bioengineering, hybrid therapeutics, and cross-species healthcare innovations. It operates hospital networks, specialized clinics, emergency care units, and experimental biolabs across multiple star systems.

UH’s infrastructure is fully compatible with all sentient and non-sentient species, including—but not limited to—humanoids, draconic species, lycanthropic hosts, fey, construct lifeforms, and other classified hybrid organisms developed under UL directives.

### **Core Functions & Responsibilities**

1. **Healthcare & Hospital Systems**
    
    - Multi-species hospitals and emergency care centers with modular wards for specific physiologies.
        
    - Adaptive medical equipment capable of treating non-humanoid anatomy (wings, tails, exoskeletons, gills, ect.).
        
    - Advanced surgical suites featuring AI-assisted nanoblade tools and integrated bioconductive monitoring.
        
2. **Pharmaceutical & Therapeutic Research**
    
    - Development of multi-species vaccines, antitoxins, and mutagenic therapeutics.
        
    - Cross-compatible medicine designed to stabilize hybrid physiology or manage thaumaturgic side effects.
        
    - Research into viral, bacterial, and parasitic threats affecting interstellar populations, including containment protocols for engineered infections such as lycanthropy or vampirism.
        
3. **Genetic & Physiological Stabilization**
    
    - Monitoring and support for hybridized or modified individuals created through UL programs.
        
    - Long-term integration of physiological enhancements or mitigating adverse reactions from public or private mutagens.
        
    - Gene therapy protocols that account for species-specific metabolism, magical affinity, and regenerative capacity.
        
4. **Emergency & Field Operations**
    
    - Rapid-deployment medical units for planetary disasters, xenobiological outbreaks, and interspecies conflict zones.
        
    - Medical drones and autonomous surgical bots capable of remote triage and stabilization in high-risk environments.
        
    - Collaboration with UL Defense and United Transit subsidiaries for evacuation, containment, and transport of critical patients.

### **Technological Assets**

- **Nanomedical Swarms:** Autonomous nanites for cellular repair, infection neutralization, and tissue regeneration.
    
- **Adaptive Bioward Suites:** Hospital units capable of morphing architecture and tools to fit the patient’s unique biology.
    
- **Integrated Biometric Monitoring:** Real-time cross-species diagnostics including energy signature scanning, magical resonance assessment, and psionic feedback monitoring.
    
- **THS (Trans-Species Hemocontainment System):** Universal blood, plasma, and fluid management compatible with hybridized and non-humanoid physiologies.

### **Strategic Mandates**

- Ensure accessible healthcare for all species under United Laboratories’ jurisdiction.
    
- Maintain research superiority in bioengineering, mutagenic therapies, and multi-species medicine.
    
- Collaborate with United Laboratories subsidiaries to manage biological threats and safeguard genetically or thaumaturgically enhanced populations.
    
- Develop preventative care and wellness protocols for humanoids and non-humanoids exposed to UL’s public mutagens, hybridization programs, or other experimental modifications.

### **Classified Notes (Internal UH Briefing)**

- UH is a principal authority in managing infections of engineered origin (e.g., lycanthropy from Andromeda, vampirism from Milky Way).
    
- Certain research divisions maintain high-security labs studying long-lived or immortal species, as well as cross-species pathogen resilience.
    
- UH maintains contingency protocols for managing hybrid and thaumaturgically augmented populations who exhibit behavioral, physiological, or magical instability.
    
- Field medics are equipped to stabilize combat-hardened or mutagenically enhanced subjects without lethal force when possible.

### **Corporate Philosophy**

_"Health without boundaries, care without limits."_  
United Health operates on the principle that all sentient and semi-sentient life deserves access to advanced medical treatment and preventative care, regardless of origin, species, or hybrid status. Its research and hospital networks serve as both humanitarian and strategic assets for United Laboratories’ interstellar operations.
