## **United Health (UH) — Viral/Parasitic Pathogen Dossier**

**Designation:** Noxis sanguinis (Symbiotic Vampirism Complex)  
**Common Name:** Vampirism / The Nocturnis Condition  
**Origin:** Milky Way — Kynor Dominion  
**Category:** Parasitic Nanobiological Symbiosis  
**Infection Scope:** Humanoids only (Homo species and other primate-like sentients)  
**Status:** Permanent, No Known Cure  
**UH Classification:** Level 4 Interstellar Biohazard — Metabolic Symbiote

### **1. Overview**

Noxis sanguinis is a **hybrid symbiotic pathogen**, originally engineered as part of the **Nocturnis Project** by the Kynor Dominion in the Milky Way. Unlike traditional viruses, the condition is a multi-component system combining:

1. **Viral Vector:** Facilitates blood-to-blood transmission.
    
2. **Engineered Micro-Colony:** Colonizes bone marrow and neural tissue to maintain permanent integration.
    
3. **Nanobot Swarm:** Regulates metabolism, tissue maintenance, and neural control.
    

The result is a humanoid host with drastically altered physiology: metabolism is dependent on hemoglobin and glucose from consumed blood, neural and muscular systems are enhanced, and aging is slowed.

### **2. Host Range and Transmission**

**Primary Hosts:**

- Humanoids

**Reservoir Hosts:**

- Non-humanoid animals are limited to temporary carriers; no transformation occurs.
    

**Transmission Vectors:**

- Blood contact (bites, transfusions, injuries)
    
- Surgical/experimental procedures in Kynor-era or rogue bio-labs
    
- Post-collapse migration of infected populations
    

**Mechanism:**

- Viral vector introduces symbiotic micro-colonies.
    
- Nanobot swarm integrates into metabolism and cellular regulation.
    
- Micro-colonies persist in stem-cell niches, making the infection irreversible.

### **3. Pathophysiology**

**Metabolic Alterations:**

- Suppressed conventional metabolism.
    
- Energy extraction via hemoglobin and glucose scavenging.
    
- Nanobot-assisted glycolysis powers muscle, neural, and organ systems.
    

**Environmental Sensitivity:**

- UV and high-intensity light degrades nanobots and destabilizes the micro-colonies.
    
- Sunlight exposure causes rapid tissue necrosis and neural failure.
    

**Enhanced Abilities:**

- Night vision and low-light perception
    
- Accelerated tissue repair
    
- Enhanced strength and reflexes
    
- Pain modulation and pheromonal influence
    
- Slowed cellular aging (functional immortality)
    

**Behavioral Consequences:**

- Aggression if deprived of blood (“blood frenzy”)
    
- Cognitive fragmentation with extended starvation
    
- Strong social and predator instincts toward prey species

### **4. Clinical Features**

|Feature|Observation|
|---|---|
|Activation|Continuous; symbiote integrates permanently|
|Dependency|Absolute; survival reliant on blood consumption|
|Sunlight Sensitivity|Acute tissue necrosis, neural failure|
|Lifespan Alteration|Functional immortality under proper sustenance|
|Cognitive Effects|Memory fragmentation during starvation; heightened predatory instinct|

### **5. Epidemiology**

- **Origin:** Engineered by Kynor Dominion for military purposes.
    
- **Spread:** Through war zones, smuggling, derelict colonies, black-market augmentation clinics.
    
- **Galactic Distribution:** Present wherever humanoid settlements intersect with Kynor remnants or their descendants.
    
- **Mutation:** Minimal; symbiote maintains genomic stability via nanobot control.

### **6. Containment and Management (UH Protocols)**

**Infectee Management:**

- Isolation during early detection or when blood supply is limited
    
- Behavioral intervention to reduce aggression and feeding risk
    
- Nighttime activity regulation to prevent collateral incidents
    

**Carrier Management:**

- Surveillance in human-adjacent colonies
    
- Screening of blood transfusions and experimental labs
    
- Monitoring rogue Kynor-era technology for dormant symbiote activation
    

**Treatment Outlook:**

- No known cure; removal results in host mortality
    
- Supportive therapies focus on safe blood supply, UV shielding, and physiological stabilization

### **7. Strategic Notes**

- Noxis sanguinis represents an **engineered military pathogen** with unintended ecological and sociological consequences.
    
- Modern vampire populations are often highly organized, exhibiting culture and social structures evolved around nocturnal predation.
    
- UH research continues on metabolic modulation, nanobot integration, and low-risk methods of managing infected populations.
    
- Vampirism contrasts with lycanthropy: both are permanent and engineered, but vampirism is **civilizational, clinical, and militarized**, while lycanthropy is **wild, ecological, and fey-engineered**.

### **8. UH Strategic Classification**

**Level 4 Interstellar Biohazard** – High containment, humanoid-specific, permanent metabolic reprogramming, restricted exposure zones required.

**Philosophical Note:**  
_"Vampirism is not a curse; it is a relic of ambition, a shadow of war, a science that demanded immortality and got it at the cost of the host’s independence."_
