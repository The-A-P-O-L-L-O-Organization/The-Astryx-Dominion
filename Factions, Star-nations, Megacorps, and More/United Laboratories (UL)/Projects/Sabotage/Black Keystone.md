## **Project: Black Keystone**

**Classification:** UL Tier-One Initiative  
**Oversight:** United Defense + United Engineering + United Quantum  
**Founder Authority:** Direct

---

### **Purpose**

Project: Black Keystone is designed to destabilize factions hostile to UL without large-scale civilian casualties. The project focuses on **precision strikes against infrastructure, military command, and communications**, crippling enemy operational capabilities while minimizing long-term ecological or population damage.

It is deployed in coordination with intelligence gathered from **Project Obsidian Eye** and field agents using **override tech** (such as the Override Spear) for maximum efficacy.

### **Key Subsystems / Modules**

#### 1. **Infrastructural Sabotage Suite**

- **Nanobot Grid Disruptors:** Infect power grids, communication lines, and transportation hubs with self-propagating nanoagents that disable systems temporarily or permanently.
    
- **Targeted EMP Arrays:** Compact units capable of knocking out localized or city-scale electronics.
    
- **Automated Breach Drones:** Deployable drones that can physically dismantle key infrastructure (bridges, depots, energy plants).
    

#### 2. **Military Force Disruption**

- **Autonomous Strike Platforms:** Small orbital platforms capable of deploying non-lethal or precision energy weapons to neutralize hostile forces.
    
- **Cyber Warfare Nodes:** UL AI modules capable of infiltrating enemy command networks, overriding robotic units, or scrambling coordination.
    
- **Disinformation Transmission:** Covert communication interference that spreads false orders or sabotages morale.
    

#### 3. **Field Integration Tools**

- All modules can interface with **override tools** carried by agents, allowing UL operatives to remotely activate, monitor, or adjust sabotage operations in real-time.
    
- Compatible with **Theseus** and other UL AIs for strategic targeting and risk analysis.

### **Tactical Use**

- **Pre-emptive Disruption:** Disable enemy systems before large-scale confrontations.
    
- **Battlefield Advantage:** Interfere with opposing military coordination, supply chains, or infrastructure while UL forces remain untouched.
    
- **Psychological Warfare:** Demonstrates UL technological superiority and control over hostile systems.
    

---

### **Deployment Method**

- Infiltrated by covert UL operatives, drone swarms, or orbital deployment.
    
- Nodes can remain dormant for long-term operations or activate on command via AI or human controllers.
    
- Fail-safes ensure civilian systems outside hostile zones are minimally affected.
    

---

### **Risks**

- Enemy countermeasures could capture or reverse-engineer sabotage tools.
    
- Overuse or improper targeting could create collateral damage or unintended socio-economic collapse.
    
- Rogue AI or misprogrammed drones could act unpredictably if disconnected from UL control.

### **Narrative Hooks / Player Interaction**

- PCs could be tasked with **planting, activating, or retrieving Black Keystone modules** in hostile territories.
    
- Missions could involve **preventing enemy interference**, debugging malfunctioning drones, or coordinating strikes across multiple fronts.
    
- Could tie into **hybrid biological sabotage projects** by coordinating with destabilized enemy populations for maximum effect.
