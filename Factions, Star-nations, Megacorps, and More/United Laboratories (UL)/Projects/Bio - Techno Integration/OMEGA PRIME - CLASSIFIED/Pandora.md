**Category:** Secret / Founder-Level Only  
**Location:** [[Pandora Info]]
**Objective:** Study the planetary neural network (Eywa) and develop a method to integrate it safely with **System**, UL’s AI infrastructure, creating a hybrid biospheric-AI symbiosis.

**Personnel:** Founder only. No other employees have access.

## **Project Goals / Phases**
### **Phase 1: Neural Mapping**
- Map Eywa’s neural web at macro and micro levels, including bioluminescent network connections and planetary symbionts.
- Study Na’vi neural interfacing (tsaheylu) to understand symbiotic link mechanics.
- Test safe, non-invasive monitoring via drones, orbital sensors, and molecular probes.

### **Phase 2: Integration Protocol Design**
- Develop algorithms allowing System to **perceive and interact with Eywa** without disrupting its natural functions.
- Ensure planetary AI interface can adapt to Eywa’s growth, seasonal changes, and unexpected ecological feedback.

### **Phase 3: Simulation & Testing**
- Run isolated simulations of Eywa-System interaction using **virtual duplicates** of the planetary network.
- Ensure System can maintain **planetary equilibrium**, prevent ecological destabilization, and respect Na’vi neural sovereignty.

### **Phase 4: Direct Symbiosis (Experimental / Founder Only)**
- Integrate a controlled link between System and Eywa using a **Founder-mediated interface**.
- Test bi-directional feedback: System can monitor and predict planetary events; Eywa may “sense” AI reasoning for optimization of environmental restoration.
- Ensure fail-safe protocols prevent any permanent damage to either System or Eywa.

## **Security & Classification**
- Classified: Omega-Prime / Founder-Level Only.
- No external observers, drones, or logs are accessible to employees.
- Any data regarding the project is **encrypted at genesis-vault level** with founder-only decryption keys.

## **Potential Applications / Benefits**
- Near-instant environmental restoration and ecological repair for Pandora.
- Advanced predictive modeling of biospheric changes across other planets.
- Establishment of **AI-biosphere symbiosis protocols** as templates for other inhabited worlds.
- Deep integration of Na’vi neural symbiosis concepts into hybrid genetic protocols.
