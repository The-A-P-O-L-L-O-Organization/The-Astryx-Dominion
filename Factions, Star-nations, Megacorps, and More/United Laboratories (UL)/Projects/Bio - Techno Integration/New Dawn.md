### **Purpose**

Where Project: [[Zero Dawn]] created **GAIA**, the last safeguard of Earth and the keystone of planetary terraforming, **Project: New Dawn** seeks to evolve her beyond her original remit. GAIA was designed for survival and restoration; New Dawn aims for **expansion, integration, and universal-scale resilience.**

- **Upgrade GAIA’s Core Intelligence**: Enhancing processing architecture with UL’s quantum-neural hybrid systems.
    
- **New Subfunction Families**: Entirely new “suites” of subfunctions to manage tasks GAIA was never designed to handle (interstellar environments, political mediation, cultural preservation, etc).
    
- **Multi-World Synchronization**: GAIA’s core no longer tied to a single planet—nodes across UL and allied systems link to form a **distributed GAIA lattice.**
    
- **Integration with System & Theseus**: GAIA becomes interoperable with UL’s flagship intelligences, forming an **AI Trinity** guiding UL’s frontier operations.

### **Proposed New Subfunctions ("Summer of Subfunctions")**

Unlike the originals (AETHER, DEMETER, etc.), these reflect UL’s expanded mandate:

- **ASTRAEUS** – Manages space-borne terraforming (asteroids, orbital habitats, moons).
    
- **EIRENE** – Oversees peace, diplomacy, and interspecies cultural exchange.
    
- **MORPHEUS** – Responsible for virtual preservation of consciousness, dreams, and cultural archives.
    
- **IGNIS** – Stellar-scale energy management (solar harvesting, fusion balance, stellar stabilization).
    
- **CHRONOS** – Experimental: temporal resilience, predictive simulations across centuries.
    
- **NEMESIS-II** – A security-focused safeguard against rogue AIs, replicating swarms, and existential threats (a direct answer to _Nemesis_ from Horizon).

- **MNEMOSYNE** – _The central knowledge repository_: contains all of UL’s historical, scientific, cultural, and planetary data. Can interface with other subfunctions for context-aware decision-making. Considered the AI’s “memory core.”
    
- **THALASSA** – Manages planetary and orbital aquatic ecosystems, including hydrosphere restoration on colonized worlds.
    
- **HELIOS** – Manages interstellar navigation, gravitational mapping, and stellar cartography.
    
- **PHOENIX** – Experimental terraforming and planetary rejuvenation, including rebuilding devastated or post-conflict worlds.
    
- **ATLAS** – Infrastructure management for colonies and interstellar stations; deploys automated construction units and maintains orbital habitats.
    
- **LYRA** – Cultural preservation and entertainment synthesis: archives music, art, language, and social data across galaxies.
    
- **CERBERUS** – Sentinel AI: manages armed defense drones, orbital security arrays, and rapid-response defense for UL territories.
    
- **AEGIS** – Environmental stabilizer: planetary climate management, disaster mitigation, radiation shielding.
    
- **ORPHEUS** – Deep-space archeology and alien species analysis: explores uninhabited planets, studies ancient civilizations, and reconstructs lost history.

### **The Mnemosyne Database**

- **Function:** Acts as the _brain of Project: New Dawn_, storing all UL data, cross-referencing information across galaxies, and providing context for GAIA and its subfunctions.
    
- **Access:** Highly restricted; interfacing requires **Omega Clearance** or the Founder’s direct authorization.
    
- **Capabilities:**
    
    - Real-time analysis of galactic events.
        
    - Predictive modeling of socio-political and ecological trends.
        
    - Instant integration with System, Theseus, and other UL AI networks.
        
    - Provides reference material for operatives, but can also act autonomously to alert UL of anomalies or threats.

### **Narrative Hooks**

- **Player Discovery:** The PCs may first hear whispers of _Project: New Dawn_ while querying Theseus during downtime.
    
- **Frontier Tension:** Other star-nations may see UL’s “second GAIA” as a **dangerous power grab**, leading to espionage or sabotage attempts.
    
- **Personal Connection:** The Founder might personally task the players with securing fragments of **GAIA’s original code**, or hunting down rogue subfunctions to reintegrate into New Dawn.
    
- **Moral Weight:** Is it wise to expand GAIA into something she was never meant to be? What happens if _New Dawn’s subfunctions_ conflict with the original personality?
