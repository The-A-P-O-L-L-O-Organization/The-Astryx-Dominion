## **Project: Revenant – Weaponized Protocol**

**Core Idea:** UL develops a standardized framework for forcibly extracting and reimplanting hostile intelligences into controlled hosts—biological or mechanical.

### **Capabilities:**

1. **Interrogation Mode**
    
    - Hostile minds are placed into limited, sensory-rich humanoid vessels.
        
    - Subjects are deprived of their original abilities (flight, psionics, alien senses).
        
    - Compliance is enforced via neural override modules.
        
2. **Puppeteering Mode**
    
    - Subject is implanted into combat-grade synthetic hosts.
        
    - Neural “leash” allows UL to pilot or restrict their actions.
        
    - Useful for using their tactical knowledge _against their own kind_.
        
3. **Disposal Mode**
    
    - If subject resists too much, their consciousness is shunted into disposable, short-lived bodies.
        
    - Continuous transfers destabilize them until they collapse into incoherence.

### **Results of Scaling**

- **United Intelligence** begins maintaining entire vaults of harvested minds—each stored in containment crystals and ready for transfer.
    
- Revenant hosts range from lifelike humanoids (for psychological breakdown) to grotesque puppet-shells (for intimidation).
    
- UL quietly refines the system so _anyone_ can be extracted—alien, AI, even hybridized beings.
