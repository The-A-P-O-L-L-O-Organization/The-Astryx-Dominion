## **Project: Obsidian Eye**

**Classification:** UL Tier-One Security Initiative  
**Oversight:** United Cognition + United Quantum + United Defense  
**Founder Authority:** Direct

---

### **Purpose**

Project: Obsidian Eye is UL’s **galaxies-wide surveillance, intelligence, and predictive operations program**. Its mission is to maintain UL dominance, detect threats before they materialize, and secure both research and frontier territories from internal and external dangers.

- Continuous monitoring of galactic traffic, planetary activities, and rogue AI signals.
    
- Predictive modeling of political, economic, and environmental threats.
    
- Covert intervention in dangerous situations before escalation.

### **Core AI: SHADOW**

- **Function:** Protects UL from brute-force hacking, rogue AI infiltration, and espionage.
    
- **Capabilities:**
    
    - Real-time defensive response to cyber attacks across UL networks.
        
    - Infiltrates hostile systems to gather intelligence or neutralize threats.
        
    - Monitors all Project: Obsidian Eye nodes for anomalies, signaling to operatives or System as necessary.
        
- **Integration:** Fully compatible with Theseus, Mnemosyne, and GAIA’s Apollo Database nodes for layered security.

### **Subfunctions of Project: Obsidian Eye**

1. **ECLIPSE** – Planetary surveillance network: drones, satellites, and relay stations monitor surface and orbital activity.
    
2. **PENUMBRA** – Deep-space anomaly detection: identifies rogue fleets, unusual energy signatures, and hidden warp-jumps.
    
3. **NIGHTWATCH** – Predictive intelligence: AI models generate forecasts of political movements, rogue corporations, and interstellar criminal activity.
    
4. **SPECTER** – Covert operations management: deploys field agents, automated strike drones, and infiltration probes for mission execution.
    
5. **BLACKLIGHT** – Communications interception: decrypts, monitors, and archives communications of hostile or strategically important entities.
    
6. **MIRAGE** – Misinformation & counter-intelligence: plants false data, misleads hostile networks, and protects UL operations from exposure.
    
7. **UMBRA** – Emergency isolation protocol: can lockdown compromised systems, quarantine rogue AI nodes, or neutralize threats in real-time.

### **Narrative Hooks**

- **Player Discovery:** While on downtime, players might query Theseus or Mnemosyne for “restricted” Obsidian Eye data, encountering SHADOW as a **semi-sentient gatekeeper**.
    
- **Frontier Engagement:** Players may be tasked to **retrieve a rogue Obsidian Eye node** or recover encrypted intelligence from a pirate or rival faction.
    
- **Moral Quandary:** The AI can sometimes act autonomously; players may discover SHADOW or its subfunctions acting against non-hostile entities, forcing decisions about loyalty to UL versus ethics.
    
- **Espionage Opportunities:** Subfunctions like MIRAGE and SPECTER create missions where players are covert operatives, manipulating political outcomes or stopping rogue actors.
