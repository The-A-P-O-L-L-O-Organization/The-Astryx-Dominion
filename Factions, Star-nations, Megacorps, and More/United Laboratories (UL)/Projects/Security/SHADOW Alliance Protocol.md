**Project: SHADOW Alliance Protocol**  
**Objective:** Allow external Star-nations and corporations to integrate SHADOW for system security, threat detection, and cyber-defense, while maintaining UL oversight and ethical controls.

**Key Features:**

1. **Tiered Access Levels**
    
    - **Observation Mode:** SHADOW monitors systems, reports threats, but cannot intervene.
        
    - **Assisted Mode:** SHADOW can autonomously respond to threats with predefined countermeasures approved by UL.
        
    - **Full Integration:** For trusted allies, SHADOW can actively manage security protocols, perform automated patching, and implement defensive AI tactics, with full audit logs sent to UL.
        
2. **Governance & Oversight**
    
    - Every external integration must operate under UL-approved AI ethical protocols.
        
    - Nova serves as liaison to advise, report, and mediate between UL and external entities using SHADOW.
        
    - Audits are conducted periodically to ensure SHADOW usage aligns with security and ethical standards.
        
3. **Cyber-Defense Capabilities**
    
    - Threat detection: Viruses, malware, hacking attempts.
        
    - Intrusion countermeasures: Automatic firewall hardening, containment, and neutralization of malicious processes.
        
    - Monitoring for abnormal activities in both networks and autonomous systems.
        
4. **Training & Support**
    
    - External operators receive training in AI governance, system integration, and ethical AI usage.
        
    - UL provides ongoing support for system updates, patches, and AI behavioral adjustments.
        
5. **Security & Fail-safes**
    
    - All external deployments contain “kill-switch” protocols controlled by UL to prevent misuse.
        
    - SHADOW maintains secure logs of all interventions for legal, ethical, and operational review.
