**Designation:** Project: Draconis Vanguard  
**Category:** Dragonborn Conversion / Hybridization  
**Status:** Active Deployment Protocol Available

---

### **Overview**

Project: Draconis Vanguard introduces draconic humanoid traits into target populations using nanoplasmid-based vectors, transforming selected hosts into fully functional **Dragonborn** operatives. Within 48–72 hours, infected subjects develop **scales, tails, claws, and elemental breath abilities**, while retaining full cognitive function and adaptability for tactical deployment.

Dragonborn operatives maintain social cohesion, can follow orders via UL neural implants, and integrate seamlessly with existing Star-Nation units. Unlike Draconids, they are **sentient, disciplined, and capable of cooperative operations**.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Aerosolized nanoplasmid spores with selective host targeting.
    
- **Delivery Systems:**
    
    - Drone-dispersed clouds for controlled inoculation.
        
    - Contaminated air-handling systems in secure facilities.
        
    - Localized field generators for precision targeting in high-risk zones.
        
- **Latency:** 6–12 hours for initial physiological transformation; full Dragonborn adaptation within 48–72 hours.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–12 hours):**

- Mild fever, slight tachycardia.
    
- Initial cellular restructuring: dermal scale clusters begin forming.
    
- Tail bud emergence.
    

**Stage II (12–36 hours):**

- Skeletal restructuring: elongation of fingers and toes, claw development.
    
- Tail elongates and becomes prehensile.
    
- Subtle facial restructuring: draconic muzzle formation and nostril adaptation.
    
- Cognitive baseline retained; emotional stability maintained.
    

**Stage III (36–60 hours):**

- Elemental organ development for breath abilities (fire, cold, acid, lightning, or poison).
    
- Scale density increases; natural armor begins forming over vital regions.
    
- Muscle and tendon restructuring for enhanced strength, endurance, and agility.
    

**Stage IV (60–72 hours):**

- Host stabilized as fully functional Dragonborn.
    
- Neural implants integrated for **override control, live translation, and tactical network interface**.
    
- Operative is physically and mentally ready for **combat, industrial, or environmental deployment**.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Planetary Defense:** Elite operatives for breach, high-heat, or high-risk combat zones.
    
- **Terraforming & Industry:** Operatives capable of operating in extreme environments, handling heavy machinery, or conducting hazardous research.
    
- **Special Operations:** Teams with elemental breath abilities provide crowd control, suppression, and environmental manipulation.
    
- **Scientific Support:** Dragonborn function as environmental specialists, lab operatives, or hazard-response units.
    

---

### **Containment & Operational Protocols**

- Dragonborn retain loyalty to UL command frequencies and implants.
    
- Vulnerabilities: high-voltage EMPs can temporarily disable implants; nerve agents targeting draconic physiology should be avoided in friendly zones.
    
- Overexposure or overdose risks: temporary wings, uncontrolled elemental surges, or extreme muscle growth; implants required for stabilization.

### **Integration Notes**

- Dragonborn operatives are assigned by **United Defense, United Terraform, and United Robotics** depending on mission needs.
    
- They operate effectively in mixed-species units alongside Aarakocra, Centaur, Goliath, and other UL hybrid populations.
    
- Cultural training emphasizes **honor, clan cooperation, and environmental adaptation**, preserving the Drakonia lineage ethos.
    
- Mutagenic enhancements can be **mission-specific**, providing temporary elemental augmentation or improved physical performance.
