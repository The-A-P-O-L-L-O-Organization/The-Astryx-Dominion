### **1. Morphogenic Sprays**

- **Effect:** Contact or inhalation causes rapid physical transformation.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Growth of extra limbs or sensory organs, making the host clumsy or disoriented.
        
    - Skin or muscle density changes, slowing movement or making armor penetration difficult.
        
    - Gender swaps or radical secondary sexual characteristic changes for psychological and social disruption.

### **2. Neural Reprogrammers**

- **Effect:** Alters thought patterns or instincts.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Host becomes paranoid or distrustful of allies.
        
    - Induces compulsive behaviors (obsessive grooming, repetitive movements, or fleeing).
        
    - Temporarily rewrites sensory interpretation, making enemies perceive allies as threats.

### **3. Symbiotic Mutations**

- **Effect:** Introduces engineered symbionts into hosts that change their biology over time.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Parasites that enhance strength or reflexes but take over motor control.
        
    - Bio-luminescent organisms integrated into the skin, making stealth impossible.
        
    - Vocal chord alteration, causing distorted communication or uncontrollable noises.

### **4. Adaptive Viral Agents**

- **Effect:** Virus-based transformations that spread in populations but are controllable via UL tech.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Gradual hybridization with local fauna, creating confused or physically incompatible soldiers.
        
    - Temporary animalistic traits like claws, enhanced senses, or fur growth that hinder uniforms/equipment use.
        
    - Cognitive shifts causing irrational fear of technology or familiar weapons.

### **5. Structural Rewrites**

- **Effect:** Alters skeletal or organ structures for sabotage.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Reconfiguring joints and limbs to make normal movement impossible.
        
    - Overgrowth of tissues causing pain and reducing stamina.
        
    - Rapid calcification or bone density changes for immobility or collapse.

### **6. Psychological & Physical Hybrids**

- **Effect:** Combined effects of body and mind changes.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Hallucinations tied to physiological transformation (e.g., seeing extra limbs where none exist).
        
    - Heightened aggression paired with muscular overgrowth, making them dangerous but uncontrollable.
        
    - Fear-inducing pheromone production, creating panic in groups of enemies.
