# **UNITED LABORATORIES – CLASSIFIED DOSSIER**

**Project:** Kaleidos  
**Classification:** Tier-Ω Biotransformation / Sabotage Initiative  
**Oversight Divisions:** United BioWorks, United Cognition, United Defense  
**Access Authorization:** Gamma Prime Clearance + Special Ops Override

---

### **OVERVIEW**

Project: Kaleidos is a multi-modal biotransformation program designed to destabilize hostile civilizations through targeted, socially and physiologically transformative agents. The project integrates genetic rewriting, nanite-mediated hybridization, and cross-agent susceptibility to produce both social and operational disruption in target populations.

The primary objective is **population destabilization**: creating visible, psychologically impactful transformations that induce ostracization, confusion, and dependency on UL intervention.

### **AGENT PROFILE**

**Vector Types:** Airborne, waterborne, foodborne, contact-transmissible  
**Mechanism of Action:**

- DNA/RNA rewriting via nanoplasmid and viral chimeras
    
- Integration of synthetic and natural species traits
    
- Induction of reproductive and secondary sex characteristic alterations
    
- Externalization of certain organ systems
    
- Retention of cognitive faculties with amplified social distress
    

**Cross-Agent Interactivity:** Fully compatible with UL-developed biological agents (e.g Agent Chimeris, Agent Mycoformis) to amplify effectiveness and maintain control.

### **STAGES OF EXPOSURE**

| Stage            | Physiological Changes                                                                            | Social Impact                                                     | Tactical Notes                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial**      | Minor skin texture shifts, subtle secondary traits, mild gender alterations                      | Social discomfort, self-consciousness                             | Early-stage monitoring recommended; exposure remains reversible in controlled conditions |
| **Intermediate** | Additional limbs, hybrid skeletal features, visible organ modifications, reproductive activation | Ostracization, rising psychological distress                      | Operational disruption begins; partial containment difficult                             |
| **Advanced**     | Full hybridization or new species forms, anthropomorphic traits, multi-organ integration         | Complete societal destabilization, formation of isolated enclaves | Ideal for maximum sabotage; irreversible without experimental intervention               |

### **DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOLS**

1. **Environmental Dispersal:** Aerosolized nanites, contaminated water supplies, or bioengineered food.
    
2. **Targeted Personnel:** Injections into key military, administrative, or cultural figures.
    
3. **Propagation Strategy:** Self-spreading nanites allow contagion among population centers for continuous destabilization.

### **CASE STUDIES**

**Case KA-001:** _Urban District, Planet Xythera_

- Exposure: Aerosolized nanites released via water supply
    
- Observed: Gender reassignment in 72% of subjects, emergence of anthropomorphic traits in 41%
    
- Outcome: Civil services collapsed, public dissent eradicated, population integrated into UL-controlled sectors
    

**Case KA-003:** _Military Outpost, Sirius Prime_

- Exposure: Direct injection of high-concentration agent
    
- Observed: Hybridization with predator traits, extreme aggression, partial hive-minded behavior
    
- Outcome: Outpost neutralized without conventional combat; survivors contained and monitored
    

---

### **CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES**

- Early exposure: Quarantine + Aeon Reversal Serum (experimental)
    
- Advanced exposure: Long-term containment in UL Black Sites; subject used as data source for AI modeling
    
- Nanite residuals: Neutralized via controlled nano-thermal treatment

### **TACTICAL OBJECTIVES**

1. Destabilize enemy societies without direct destruction
    
2. Transform high-value personnel into controllable or incapacitated forms
    
3. Amplify psychological impact on civilian and military populations
    
4. Enable long-term surveillance and integration into UL infrastructure

### **ETHICAL NOTES (CLASSIFIED)**

Project: Kaleidos is recognized as high-risk for psychological trauma. All operators are reminded that collateral effects extend to civilian populations. The objective prioritizes strategic control and population engineering over conventional combat efficacy.
