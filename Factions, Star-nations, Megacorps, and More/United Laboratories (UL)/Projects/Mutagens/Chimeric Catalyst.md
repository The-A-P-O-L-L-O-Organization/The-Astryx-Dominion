**UL Classified — Chimeric Catalyst Project Dossier**

**Codename:** Chimeric Catalyst  
**Type:** Planetary-scale mutagenic device  
**Purpose:** Transform or destabilize planetary populations, ecosystems, or biochemistry as part of UL’s strategic contingency or experimental influence programs.

### **1) Concept Overview**

The Chimeric Catalyst is not a conventional explosive—it’s a mutagenic propagation system. Upon detonation, the device disperses a highly concentrated mutagenic energy field across the planet’s biosphere. The resulting “explosion” is largely invisible in physical terms; there is no fireball or shockwave, but a quantum-linked mutagenic flux spreads in seconds to minutes, affecting organisms at a genetic and hybridization level.

### **2) Mechanism of Action**

1. **Energy Release:** The bomb contains ultra-condensed mutagenic energy (similar to UL’s experimental “mutagenic electricity”) stored in a quantum-stable lattice.
    
2. **Detonation Trigger:** Upon activation, it converts the lattice into a mutagenic energy field, amplified by atmospheric dispersal systems integrated into the device.
    
3. **Hybridization Pulse:** Organisms exposed to the flux undergo near-instantaneous hybridization or mutation, depending on species, genome complexity, and prior exposure to mutagens.
    
4. **Environmental Feedback:** Plants, microbes, and planetary ecosystems begin adapting in real-time, sometimes generating secondary hybridization effects.
    
5. **Persistence:** Some effects can be long-lasting, potentially creating permanent hybrid populations or mutagenic anomalies on the planet.

### **3) Tactical/Strategic Use**

- **Planetary Neutralization:** Disable hostile worlds without conventional weapons; entire populations transformed or destabilized.
    
- **Controlled Experiments:** Test hybridization outcomes at scale for UL research or pre-colony adaptation.
    
- **Infiltration Tool:** Convert a population into compliant hybrid species or organisms with latent UL-specific bio-modules.

### **4) Deployment**

- **Delivery Methods:**
    
    - Orbital drop from UL ships.
        
    - Planetary insertion via probes or subterranean launch mechanisms.
        
- **Activation Options:**
    
    - Timed detonation for controlled experimentation.
        
    - Remote trigger via encrypted UL communication protocols.
        

---

### **5) Safety and Containment**

- The device contains fail-safes preventing unintended detonation during transport.
    
- Containment fields suppress mutagenic leakage until activation.
    
- Only UL-authorized personnel or AI (e.g., SHADOW) may interface with the control systems.

### **6) Ethical Considerations**

- Classified at the highest UL clearance level; intended for extreme contingencies.
    
- Potential for massive collateral mutation makes it a weapon of last resort.
    
- Deployment is sanctioned under GC oversight, with “plausible deniability” protocols embedded in the system.

### **7) Narrative/Campaign Hooks**

- **Espionage:** A rogue faction attempts to steal or replicate Chimeric Catalyst tech.
    
- **Mutation Aftermath:** Planetary populations evolve rapidly after deployment, creating a frontier of hybrid species.
    
- **Moral Dilemma:** UL operatives must weigh strategic advantage against the suffering of entire ecosystems.
