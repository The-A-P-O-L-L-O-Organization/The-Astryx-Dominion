**Designation:** Project: Sus Scutum 🐖  
**Category:** Hybridization — Strength & Utility Unit  
**Status:** Active Testing

---

### **Overview**

Project: Sus Scutum transforms hosts into pig-like hybrids, emphasizing strength, resilience, and environmental adaptability. These hybrids are intended for labor, siege, and subversive operations in hostile or urban environments. Hosts grow to roughly the size of an adult pig of their age.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating suid DNA sequences into the host genome.
- **Delivery:** Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.
- **Latency:** 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

---

### **Transformation Stages**
**Stage I (0–6 hours):**
- Subtle physical adaptations: increased muscle mass, thicker skin, and minor facial reshaping.
- Enhanced olfactory perception for tracking and environmental awareness.

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**
- Hooved extremities form; tusk-like teeth begin to appear.
- Body becomes more robust; metabolism adjusts for energy-intensive activity.
- Skin thickens and develops natural protective qualities.

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**
- Full pig hybrid form realized:
    - Size comparable to an adult pig of the host's age.
    - Enhanced strength and endurance; capable of breaching barriers.
    - Neural enhancements optimize spatial awareness, foraging instincts, and cooperative behavior in groups.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Labor & Siege:** Can manipulate heavy objects, break through fortifications, or dig for strategic purposes.
- **Environmental Adaptation:** Thrives in swamps, urban ruins, or hostile terrain.
- **Covert Disruption:** Can be used to sabotage infrastructure quietly through burrowing or trampling.
- **Group Coordination:** Operates effectively in small units guided by UL override signals.    

---

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural implants allow UL remote guidance and override via **Project: Override Spear** or **Omega Prime clearance**.
- Monitoring is required to prevent accidental property damage or exposure to civilians.
- Nutritional needs are moderate; metabolism allows sustained heavy work.

### **Psychological Notes**

- Hosts retain near-full human intelligence, but instincts for rooting, foraging, and cooperative behavior dominate.
- Physical adaptations may create behavioral conflicts in non-mission environments.
- Strong social instincts encourage herd-like coordination, increasing efficiency in team operations.
