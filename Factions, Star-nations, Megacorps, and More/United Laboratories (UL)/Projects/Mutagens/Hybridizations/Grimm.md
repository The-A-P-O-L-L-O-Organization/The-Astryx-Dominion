**Status:** Public Demonstration Series — Active Deployment

### **Overview**

**Project: Grimm** represents one of United BioWorks’ _aesthetic hybridization_ initiatives — merging **Cinnabar moth** genetics with humanoid physiology to create a being of striking crimson-black coloration, enhanced perception, and **bio-luminal energy control**.

Unlike prior hybrids built for war or labor, the **Grimm-Class Hybrids** were designed to embody **living art**, blending biological performance, emotional resonance, and kinetic energy manipulation. The project’s guiding principle: _“Beauty and power are not opposites.”_

Grimm Hybrids can absorb ambient or directed energy — heat, light, kinetic motion — and redistribute it as controlled bursts of **bio-luminescent flame or aura**. In practice, this energy can be used defensively, offensively, or artistically in synchronized displays.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Refined _Insecta-Cinnabaris_ genome vector (derived from _Tyria jacobaeae_) combined with photonic gland augmentation.
    
- **Delivery:** Intramuscular injection followed by cocoon-phase gestation (72 hours).
    
- **Latency:** 24 hours post-emergence for full power stabilization.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I — Metamorphic Induction (0–24 hours)**

- Increased body temperature and red pigmentation across shoulders, back, and arms.
    
- Visual spectrum expands into **near-infrared**, allowing perception of heat signatures.
    
- A faint **crimson glow** begins pulsing at pulse points (wrists, throat, chest).
    

**Stage II — Chrysalis Phase (24–72 hours)**

- Host enters stasis cocoon woven from secreted silk-protein threads.
    
- Musculature and skeletal density reorganize to support energy-channeling organs.
    
- Neural restructuring enhances **emotional-to-energetic transference** (the ability to convert passion, fear, or focus into usable energy).
    

**Stage III — Emergence (72–96 hours)**

- **Wings manifest**, patterned in red and black with reflective scaling; capable of silent flight or gliding.
    
- **Bio-luminescent glands** activate, producing energy “flame” that radiates without combustion — a light that dances, not burns.
    
- **Energy Pulse Organ** forms behind sternum, serving as a living capacitor.
    
- Host gains the ability to **project aura** as a field of illumination, temperature modulation, or concussive force.

### **Abilities & Tactical Applications**

- **Aura Projection:** Emit controllable red-black luminescence capable of blinding, heating, or stunning opponents.
    
- **Energy Symphony:** Synchronize with other Grimm Hybrids to create harmonic energy fields for defense or crowd control.
    
- **Thermal Absorption:** Draw energy from heat sources or sunlight to heal or amplify abilities.
    
- **Flight / Glide:** Winged locomotion, silent in air, with low-gravity control during energy bursts.
    
- **Stagecraft Synchronization:** Used by **United Entertainment** in holo-theater performances to merge live energy projection with AI choreography.

### **Control & Containment**

- No internal override module required; all Grimm Hybrids are _publicly registered_ and voluntarily synchronized with UL’s **Resonance Network** for safety.
    
- Overexertion can cause **“burnout” syndrome**, resulting in temporary loss of glow and extreme fatigue.
    
- Cold environments drastically reduce performance due to slowed energy circulation.

### **Psychological & Behavioral Notes**

- The transformation amplifies emotion-based responses; Grimm Hybrids are **expressive, passionate, and magnetic personalities**, often artists, performers, or diplomats.
    
- The moth lineage instills a fascination with flame, light, and transformation — many describe feeling “drawn to energy” both literally and metaphorically.
    
- Dream activity intensifies, often featuring imagery of performance, metamorphosis, or crimson flame.
