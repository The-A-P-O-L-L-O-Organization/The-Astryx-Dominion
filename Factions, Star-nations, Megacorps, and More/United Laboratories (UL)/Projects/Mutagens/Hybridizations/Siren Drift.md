Designation: Project: Siren Drift
Category: Hybridization — Aquatic & Heavy Support Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**

Project: Siren Drift transforms hosts into manatee-like hybrids, emphasizing aquatic endurance, strength, and adaptability. These hybrids are intended for underwater operations, heavy labor, and territorial control in hostile aquatic environments.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating sirenian DNA sequences into host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aquatic exposure chambers, or spire-mediated dispersal.  
Latency: 8–16 hours for initial transformation.

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–8 hours):**

- Subtle physical adaptations: enhanced lung capacity, minor skin thickening, and initial subcutaneous fat redistribution.
    
- Hands and feet begin broadening; slight webbing appears between digits.
    

**Stage II (8–16 hours):**

- Full aquatic limb adaptation: flippers form, tail beginning to flatten and elongate.
    
- Musculature restructured for endurance swimming; host develops natural buoyancy.
    
- Skin becomes smooth and dense; sensory whiskers (vibrissae) emerge along face and torso.
    

**Stage III (16–24 hours):**

- Full manatee hybrid form realized:
    
    - Flippered limbs and horizontal tail fin optimized for underwater propulsion.
        
    - Thickened dermis and dense subcutaneous fat for temperature regulation and impact resistance.
        
    - Neural enhancements for sonar-like environmental awareness and underwater coordination with other hybrids.
        

Hosts retain human-level intelligence, enabling complex decision-making and coordination in aquatic scenarios.

**Tactical Applications**

- **Underwater Recon & Sabotage:** Capable of infiltrating submerged facilities, pipelines, and aquatic bases.
    
- **Heavy Support:** Can manipulate submerged infrastructure or machinery with enhanced strength.
    
- **Territorial Control:** Natural buoyancy and size make them effective in controlling waterways or aquatic chokepoints.
    
- **Group Coordination:** Can operate in pods, guided by UL override signals.

**Control & Containment**

- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Hosts require monitoring in mixed environments to prevent accidental discovery or panic.
    
- Nutritional requirements are minimal due to highly efficient metabolism and aquatic food adaptability.

**Psychological Notes**

- Hosts may develop strong social bonds, mimicking pod dynamics.
    
- Adaptation to aquatic life can cause disorientation on land; training required to prevent cognitive conflicts.
    
- Docile but potentially territorial behaviors can emerge if isolated from pod or mission context.
