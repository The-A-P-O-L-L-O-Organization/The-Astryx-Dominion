Designation: Project: Selachimorph Apex
Category: Hybridization — Aquatic Assault & Recon Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**

Project: Selachimorph Apex transforms hosts into shark-like hybrids, emphasizing aquatic dominance, enhanced predation, and durability. These hybrids are intended for operations in oceans, lakes, or large bodies of water, capable of stealth attacks, reconnaissance, and territorial control.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Viral-genetic construct integrating selachian (shark) DNA sequences into the host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aquatic exposure via UL spires, or spire-mediated aerosolization for marine infiltration.  
Latency: 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Rapid growth begins, increasing host mass to match shark size for their age.
    
- Skin thickens, developing dermal denticles for hydrodynamic efficiency and minor protection.
    
- Teeth elongate and harden; jaw musculature strengthens.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Fins develop: dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins for aquatic mobility.
    
- Gills form, enabling full underwater respiration.
    
- Musculature adjusts for powerful swimming, striking, and endurance in aquatic environments.
    

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**

- Full shark hybrid form realized:
    
    - Body size matches a shark of the host’s age.
        
    - Teeth, jaws, and tail optimized for predation.
        
    - Neural enhancements maintain intelligence for mission objectives, despite physical transformation.
        
    - Sensory systems enhanced: electroreception, lateral line detection, and acute smell underwater.

**Tactical Applications**

- **Aquatic Assault:** Can engage enemy forces in water or coastal regions with predatory efficiency.
    
- **Reconnaissance:** Able to traverse oceans quickly while remaining largely undetected.
    
- **Sabotage:** Can disrupt aquatic installations, naval fleets, or supply routes.
    
- **Territorial Control:** Effective for creating zones of dominance in hostile aquatic environments.

**Control & Containment**

- Neural implants allow remote guidance and UL command through Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Requires monitored deployment to prevent accidental harm to civilian populations or unintended zones.
    
- Nutritional requirements scale with increased mass; aquatic adaptation allows natural hunting or supplemented feeding.

**Psychological Notes**

- Host retains intelligence but instincts for hunting may override certain social behaviors.
    
- Enhanced sensory perception underwater may be disorienting on land initially.
    
- Physical size and predatory adaptations can induce psychological stress if untrained.
