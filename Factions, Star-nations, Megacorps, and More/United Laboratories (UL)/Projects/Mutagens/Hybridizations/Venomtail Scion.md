Designation: Project: Venomtail Scion
Category: Hybridization — Stealth & Lethality Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**
Project: Venomtail Scion transforms hosts into scorpion-like hybrids, emphasizing stealth, durability, and natural lethality. These hybrids are intended for infiltration, assassination, and targeted disruption in hostile environments.

---

**Vector & Delivery**
Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating scorpion DNA sequences into host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.  
Latency: 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

---

**Transformation Stages**
**Stage I (0–6 hours):**
- Subtle physical adaptations: slight body shrinkage, increased reflex speed, and exoskeletal thickening along extremities.
- Neural pathways adjust for enhanced sensory perception and prey detection.

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**
- Tail growth begins, equipped with a venomous stinger.
- Hands and feet morph into multi-segmented, claw-like structures for gripping and climbing.
- Carapace develops partial armor along the back, forearms, and legs.
- Eyes adjust for heightened low-light vision and movement detection.

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**
- Full scorpion hybrid form realized:
    - Small, compact body optimized for stealth, ambush, and mobility in narrow or hazardous terrain.
    - Fully formed venomous tail capable of delivering paralyzing or incapacitating toxins.
    - Limb musculature supports rapid movement, climbing, and leaping.
    - Neural enhancements enhance strategic hunting, environmental awareness, and cooperative attacks.

Hosts retain near-human intelligence, allowing tactical decision-making while executing lethal maneuvers.

**Tactical Applications**
- **Infiltration:** Small size allows undetected movement through tight or complex environments.
- **Assassination/Neutralization:** Venomous stinger can incapacitate or eliminate high-value targets.
- **Surveillance & Sabotage:** Agility and stealth enable reconnaissance or disruption of enemy operations.
- **Team Coordination:** Instinctive pack behavior allows for coordinated assaults under UL guidance.

---

**Control & Containment**

- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
- Careful monitoring is required to prevent accidental engagement of host in populated or controlled areas.
- Metabolism adapted for survival in minimal-food conditions while maintaining venom production and energy for high agility.

**Psychological Notes**
- Heightened predatory instincts may conflict with prior human social behavior.
- Shrinking and body modification can cause psychological stress if not properly conditioned.
- Strong focus on stealth, hunting, and territorial behavior; requires regular training and oversight.
