United Laboratories — Project File  
Designation: Project: Rodentum Veil 🐀  
Category: Hybridization — Stealth & Infiltration Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**

Project: Rodentum Veil transforms hosts into rat-like hybrids, emphasizing stealth, infiltration, and reconnaissance. These hybrids are intended for covert operations, sabotage, and intelligence gathering in hostile or densely populated zones. Their small size allows them to access locations unreachable by standard operatives.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating rodent DNA sequences into the host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.  
Latency: 4–12 hours for initial transformation.

---

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–4 hours):**

- Host begins to shrink gradually.
    
- Subtle sensory adaptations: enhanced smell, hearing, and night vision.
    

**Stage II (4–8 hours):**

- Fur develops; extremities lengthen for climbing and grasping.
    
- Tail emerges for balance and tactile exploration.
    
- Dental adaptations: incisors strengthen for gnawing and defensive purposes.
    

**Stage III (8–12 hours):**

- Full rat hybrid form realized:
    
    - Size reduced to roughly that of a typical rat.
        
    - Limb structure optimized for agility, climbing, and stealth movement.
        
    - Neural adjustments heighten alertness, spatial awareness, and problem-solving.
        
    - Retains near-full intelligence and mission comprehension despite size reduction.

**Tactical Applications**

- **Infiltration:** Can navigate tight spaces, ventilation shafts, or security systems.
    
- **Espionage:** Perfect for eavesdropping and gathering sensitive intelligence.
    
- **Sabotage:** Capable of discreetly disrupting machinery, wiring, or defenses.
    
- **Stealth Recon:** Operates undetected in enemy facilities, urban zones, or wilderness.
    

---

**Control & Containment**

- Neural implants allow UL remote guidance and override via Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Must be monitored for accidental exposure to high-risk hazards due to extreme size reduction.
    
- Nutritional needs are minimal; metabolism adapted to host’s small size.
    

---

**Psychological Notes**

- Small stature and enhanced instincts may cause anxiety or claustrophobia in some hosts.
    
- Rat instincts for foraging and caution are strong, reinforcing stealth behavior.
    
- Requires careful training to balance predator avoidance instincts with mission objectives.

## Small humanoid (hybrid), any alignment

---

Ability Score Increase

Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

Age

Rodentum Veil hybrids mature quickly, usually within a few years after transformation, and live 60–80 years if not culled or contained.

Alignment

Instinctive caution and survival traits push many toward neutral alignments. However, when working in groups, they may lean lawful, obeying the strongest or most cunning leader.

Size

Small. Rodentum Veil hybrids shrink drastically, becoming rat-sized humanoids between 1–2 feet tall and weighing 5–15 pounds.

Speed

Your base walking speed is 25 ft.
You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.


---

Darkvision

Accustomed to low-light conditions, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Keen Senses

You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

Gnawing Bite

Your incisors are natural weapons. You can use them to make unarmed strikes, dealing 1d4 + your Strength modifier piercing damage on a hit. Your bite can also damage or weaken wooden, leather, or rope restraints at DM discretion.

Stealth Instincts

You have proficiency in the Stealth skill.
In addition, when you take the Hide action, you can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured (such as behind debris, in dim light, or in crowds).

Pack Skitter

When within 10 feet of an allied Rodentum Veil hybrid, you may use the Help action as a bonus action once per short or long rest.

Small and Agile

You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

Disease Resilience

You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance to poison damage.

Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon. Many also communicate through high-pitched chitters and body language.
