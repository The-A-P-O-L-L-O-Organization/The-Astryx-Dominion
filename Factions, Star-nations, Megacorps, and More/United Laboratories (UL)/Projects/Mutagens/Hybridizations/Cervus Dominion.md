**Designation:** Project: Cervus Dominion
**Category:** Hybridization — Strength & Terrain Mastery Unit  
**Status:** Active Testing

### **Overview**

Project: Cervus Dominion transforms hosts into elk-like hybrids, emphasizing size, stamina, and environmental adaptability. These hybrids are intended for patrolling, defense, and strategic operations in forested or open terrain. Hosts grow to roughly the size of an adult elk of their age, giving them impressive physical presence while retaining near-human intelligence.

### **Vector & Delivery**
- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating cervid DNA sequences into the host genome.
- **Delivery:** Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.
- **Latency:** 6–18 hours for full transformation.

---

### **Transformation Stages**
**Stage I (0–6 hours):**
- Host begins gradual growth and skeletal restructuring.
- Musculature strengthens, heightening stamina and mobility.

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**
- Limbs elongate and digitigrade posture develops for running efficiency.
- Hoof structures replace extremities; antler buds emerge on the skull.
- Senses, particularly smell and hearing, become highly acute.

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**
- Full Cervus Dominion form realized:
    - Size roughly that of an adult elk of the host's age.
    - Antlers fully developed and capable of use in defense or dominance displays.
    - Muscular frame optimized for speed, endurance, and obstacle navigation.
    - Fur thickens for climate adaptability.
    - Neural adaptations enhance spatial awareness, strategic movement, and herd coordination instincts.

### **Tactical Applications**
- **Patrol & Security:** Ideal for monitoring large forested or open areas.
- **Mobility & Transportation:** Capable of carrying light equipment or small loads across difficult terrain.
- **Disruption:** Can intimidate or physically disrupt hostile formations with strength and herd behavior.
- **Environmental Adaptation:** Well-suited to operate in rugged or extreme terrain.

### **Control & Containment**
- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via **Project: Override Spear** or **Omega Prime clearance**.
- Care required to prevent accidental exposure to hazards due to large size.
- Nutritional needs are elevated to support increased body mass and energy expenditure.

### **Psychological Notes**
- Instinctual herd behaviors may emerge; careful conditioning ensures operational compliance.
- Hosts retain intelligence for planning and coordination, but dominance instincts could lead to conflicts if unmonitored.
- Presence of antlers and large size can induce both psychological intimidation and stress in host if not gradually acclimated.
