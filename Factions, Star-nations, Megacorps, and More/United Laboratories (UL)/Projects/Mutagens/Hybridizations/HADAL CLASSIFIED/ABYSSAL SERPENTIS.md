# **United Laboratories — Personnel & Asset Dossier**

## **SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN**

**Acquired:** ████████  
**Designation:** _Project ABYSSAL SERPENTIS – Host Variant S-3_  
**Status:** _Containment Breach / Asset Lost (Still Active)_

---

# **I. Physical Description**

Subject S-3 exhibits the standard morphological profile expected of _Serpentis-class hybridization_. Host body has fully transitioned into a serpentine structure resembling an elongated sea-snake organism.

**Primary morphological attributes:**

• **Body Structure:**  
Elongated serpentine form; dermal surface covered in smooth, pressure-adaptive **light blue scales**. Mobility optimized for aquatic and semi-aquatic travel.

• **Caudal Features:**  
Fully developed tail fin with **dual dorsal stabilizer fins**. Caudal length fortified with internal storage pouches engineered to carry mutagen samples, supply capsules, or organic reagent vials. Subject repurposes them for contraband and trade goods.

• **Arms / Appendages:**  
Possesses **three functional arms**. Extra arm manifests on left lateral segment as predicted in Stage II hybridization.  
Leftmost arm remains wrapped in a self-applied **bloodied bandage** (origin undetermined; subject refuses examination).

Hands retain humanoid articulation but end in **claw-like, black-gradient keratin structures**. Digit count is four—**a Serpentis design choice**, not a deformity.

• **Cranial Structure:**  
Humanoid face retains baseline expressiveness.  
Key alterations include:

– **angler-type esca** on forehead (bioluminescent; used for distraction and signaling)  
– **finned auditory appendages** replacing ears  
– **fish-like mouth** adapted for low-oxygen environments  
– **third sensory eye** on right orbital ridge granting multi-spectrum vision  
– **black wavy hair**, short, grown post-transformation (resistant to water distortion)

**General Notes:**  
Subject displays no signs of physical regression. All features remain stable despite lack of UL maintenance.

# **II. Psychological Profile**

Subject S-3 exhibits several persistent behavioral traits typical of Serpentis hybrid hosts but amplified to an unusual degree:

• **Snark-Dominant Communication:**  
Tendency toward sarcasm, derision, and mocking commentary, especially when observing the failure or death of others.  
UL Behavior Division lists this as _“merchant-class adaptive deflection.”_

• **Unpredictable & Hyperreactive:**  
Fast oscillation between humor, aggression, and neutrality.  
Not considered mentally unstable—merely neurologically re-wired.

• **High Cognitive Flexibility:**  
Shows above-expected memory retention, market awareness, pattern recognition, and hazard evaluation.  
Useful for scouting, but makes subject difficult to control.

• **UL Hostility:**  
Displays extreme resentment toward UL staff and infrastructure.  
Attempts sabotage whenever possible.  
This behavior is common among Serpentis hosts but is **most pronounced in S-3**.

• **Selective Empathy:**  
Will treat non-UL prisoners and independent operators with consistent respect.  
Subject demonstrates **unexpected pro-social tendencies** toward those who assist him.  
However, irritation or provocation can produce immediate aggression.

• **Merchant-Class Instinct Conditioning:**  
Subject is compelled—biologically—to gather, trade, and barter materials.  
This was an intended trait of the Serpentis mutagen and persists despite Subject’s UL resistance.

**Assessment:**  
Psychology Division classifies S-3 as

> **“Cooperative when appeased. Lethal when bored.”**  
> Considered a **Tier-3 Manipulator Type** and an ongoing PR threat.

# **III. Mutagen Origin — _Project: ABYSSAL SERPENTIS_**

_(Summary extracted from discontinued project files)_

**Category:** Adaptive Aquatic Hybridization – Recon/Merchant Variant  
**Status:** Legacy; mutagen stock removed to new HADAL site prior to old facility demolition.

Project goal was to create a **hyper-adaptive, semi-autonomous organism** capable of thriving in hostile aquatic and liquid-atmosphere environments while retaining:

– independent problem-solving  
– market/trade aptitude  
– scavenging efficiency  
– reconnaissance ability  
– expendability  
– theoretical obedience to UL compliance systems

Subject S-3 represents the most successful _physiological_ result but ranks lowest in _behavioral compliance_.

# **IV. Documented Behaviors in Containment**

While housed in old HADAL Sub-Menagerie, Subject displayed:

• repeated escape attempts  
• manipulation of other hybrids  
• theft of mutagen vials (classified)  
• construction of improvised weapons  
• mockery of staff during medical evaluations  
• refusal to comply with psychological conditioning  
• use of tail-pouch storage for black-market trades with prisoners

Containment logs describe Subject as:

> “Highly social, highly dangerous, functionally feral, but eloquent.”

Multiple staff reports note his conversational skill and awareness of each employee’s habits, fears, and personal weaknesses—information he used liberally.

---

# **V. Interaction Protocol (Obsolete)**

UL personnel were instructed:

• Do **not** approach subject alone.  
• Do **not** reference Project Serpentis designation.  
• Do **not** attempt sedative delivery without reinforced injection armature.  
• Do **not** respond to subject’s provocations, humor, or bargaining attempts.  
• Do not permit access to any personal belongings (“he will steal them”).  
• Do not permit contact with other hybrids unless testing.

Subject is considered fully lost to UL following the abandonment of old HADAL.

# **VI. Current Threat Level**

UL Threat Index: **SEVERE (Red Tier)**  
Justification:

• highly mobile  
• intelligent  
• deeply motivated against UL  
• capable of blending into independent trading networks  
• familiar with HADAL architecture, mutagen storage, and security systems  
• known to assist escaping prisoners  
• “unpredictable loyalty profile”

**Recommended Action:**  
Track and recapture **only** with specialized team.  
Terminations prohibited—mutagenic instability risk remains high.
