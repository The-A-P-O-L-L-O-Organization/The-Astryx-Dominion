**Designation:** Project: Abyssal Leviathan  
**Category:** Hybridization — Heavy Assault / Abyssal Brute  
**Status:** Experimental Deployment

### **Overview**

Project: Abyssal Leviathan transforms human hosts into enormous, physically dominant hybrids optimized for extreme strength, resilience, and underwater endurance. Designed for deep-sea operations, facility control, and high-risk extraction missions, this mutagen also integrates a neural loyalty bond to the designated controlling subject (Sebastian). Leto’s transformation prioritizes raw power and survivability while allowing limited cognitive function to coordinate with allies.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating traits from deep-ocean leviathans, abyssal fish, and cephalopod musculature.
    
- **Delivery:** Intravenous injection or immersion in an enriched mutagenic solution.
    
- **Latency:** 6–12 hours for initial physical growth; neural bonding stabilizes over 14–20 hours.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Rapid skeletal expansion begins; height and mass increase by 30–50% relative to baseline.
    
- Musculature densifies and elongates, preparing the host for extreme strength output.
    
- Minor dermal thickening and water-resistant adaptations appear.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Size continues increasing; Leto approaches facility-constrained maximum dimensions.
    
- Limb and torso musculature reconfigures for power-based movement and stability underwater.
    
- Neural pathways initiate alignment with controlling subject; instinctive cooperation begins.
    

**Stage III (12–18 hours):**

- Physical form stabilizes at extreme size: approximately facility-capable bulk with reinforced bone and cartilage structures.
    
- Tail-like coccygeal growth begins, providing balance and rudimentary aquatic propulsion.
    
- Sensory enhancement for pressure, vibration, and low-light environments develops.
    

**Stage IV (18–24 hours):**

- Full hybrid physiology achieved:
    
    - Dense, armored hide resistant to blunt trauma and environmental hazards.
        
    - Neural bonding pathways fully active; host instinctively protects controlling subject and coordinates with allied hybrids.
        
    - Increased metabolism and dietary needs to sustain augmented musculature.

### **Tactical & Practical Applications**

- **Heavy Assault:** Physical dominance to breach security or disable threats.
    
- **Deep-Sea Operations:** Able to traverse high-pressure aquatic environments.
    
- **Team Support:** Acts as a powerful anchor or tank in group maneuvers, responding to controlling subject’s cues.
    
- **Defense & Deterrence:** Size and strength provide psychological and physical intimidation.

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural integration allows controlling subject (Sebastian) to influence instincts, maintain loyalty, and coordinate actions.
    
- Requires reinforced environmental accommodations due to mass and strength.
    
- Diet and rest protocols essential for maintaining muscular and cognitive function.

### **Psychological Notes**

- Initial awareness may be disorienting; the sheer scale of the host’s body can induce anxiety.
    
- Loyalty bond with controlling subject mitigates aggression and focuses behavioral instincts.
    
- Cognitive function retained for task-specific coordination but can be overridden by reflexive survival and protective instincts.
