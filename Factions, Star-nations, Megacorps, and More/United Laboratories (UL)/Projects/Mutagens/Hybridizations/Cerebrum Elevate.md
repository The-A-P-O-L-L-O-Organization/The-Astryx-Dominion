**Category:** Non-Invasive Neural Augmentation  
**Status:** Active & Publicly Available

---

### **Overview**

Project: Cerebrum Elevate provides voluntary, safe cognitive augmentation for civilians and UL employees. Unlike Project: Cerebrum Ascendant (experimental), this program prioritizes comfort, safety, and controlled intellectual enhancement.

Enhancements include:

- Moderate increase in processing speed, memory recall, and problem-solving.
    
- Heightened pattern recognition and multitasking ability.
    
- Emotional regulation and stress management improvements.
    
- User retains full autonomy and personality.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Non-viral nanite-based neuro-enhancement system.
    
- **Delivery:** Oral capsule or subcutaneous injection.
    
- **Latency:** Effects manifest gradually over 24–72 hours.
    
- **Reversibility:** Modest enhancements are reversible via follow-up treatment.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–24 hours):**

- Nanites integrate into cortical and hippocampal regions.
    
- Users notice slightly improved memory and focus.
    

**Stage II (24–48 hours):**

- Cognitive pathways optimized for multitasking and logical reasoning.
    
- Users experience enhanced perception of patterns and relationships.
    

**Stage III (48–72 hours):**

- Final integration stabilizes neural enhancements.
    
- Users report increased creativity, problem-solving capacity, and emotional clarity.
