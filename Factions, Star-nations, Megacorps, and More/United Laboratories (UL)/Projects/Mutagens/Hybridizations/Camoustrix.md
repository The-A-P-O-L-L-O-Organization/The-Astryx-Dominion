**Designation:** Project: Camoustrix 🐛  
**Category:** Hybridization — Stealth, Camouflage & Reconnaissance  
**Status:** Active Testing

---

### **Overview**

Project: Camoustrix transforms hosts into stickbug-like hybrids. The primary emphasis is stealth, environmental camouflage, and slow, controlled movement. This hybrid is intended for reconnaissance, ambush tactics, and urban or forest espionage where visual detection is a primary concern.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating Phasmatodea DNA and neural camouflage genes.
    
- **Delivery:** Spinal or cranial injection; aerosolized exposure for high-density operations.
    
- **Latency:** 6–18 hours for initial transformation.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Limbs elongate and thin.
    
- Skin cells begin restructuring for chameleon-like color adaptation.
    
- Neural pathways heighten sensory input for movement and environment scanning.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Full exoskeletal reinforcement in limbs and torso for balance.
    
- Finger and toe joints become prehensile for grasping branches, poles, or wires.
    
- Facial structure elongates subtly, maintaining near-human sensory organs but optimized for peripheral awareness.
    

**Stage III (12–18 hours):**

- Full stickbug appearance realized:
    
    - Limbs thin and twig-like but flexible.
        
    - Skin fully adaptive to background (wood, stone, foliage).
        
    - Posture and movement optimized for extreme stealth.
        
    - Neural adaptation allows near-instant camouflage response to surroundings.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Reconnaissance:** Can move undetected through dense forests, urban areas, or surveillance zones.
    
- **Ambush & Sabotage:** Perfect for positioning in high-visibility areas without detection.
    
- **Observation:** Ideal for covert observation of enemy or alien activity with minimal exposure risk.

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural implants allow UL remote guidance and override via Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Must avoid exposure to predators, hazards, or environmental extremes due to slender, delicate form.
    
- Minimal nutritional needs; metabolism adapted to low-energy survival mode.

### **Psychological Notes**

- Extremely slow movement and forced stealth may induce stress or claustrophobia in some hosts.
    
- High reliance on camouflage can create social anxiety when operating in non-combat environments.
    
- Careful training ensures mission compliance while maintaining host autonomy and well-being.
