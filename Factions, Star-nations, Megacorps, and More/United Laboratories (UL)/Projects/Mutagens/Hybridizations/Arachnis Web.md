**Designation:** Project: Arachnis Web  
**Category:** Hybridization Bio-Weaponization  
**Status:** Field Testing Phase

### **Overview**

Project: Arachnis Web introduces arachnid (spider/scorpion hybrid) mutagenic enhancements into biological hosts, converting them into fast-moving, stealth-capable predators that excel in ambush, infiltration, and population control.

Unlike Project: Leonine Aspect (which favors shock-pack warfare), Arachnis Web thrives in **urban and subterranean environments**, using webs, venom, and ambush tactics to break enemy cohesion and sow paranoia. Transformation stabilizes within **48 hours**.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Neuro-hemotoxic mutagen (blood + nerve attack).
    
- **Delivery Systems:**
    
    - Micro-drone “mosquito injectors.”
        
    - Contaminated air vents in population centers.
        
    - Direct injection into captured operatives.
        
- **Latency:** Visible mutations after 6 hours.

### **Infection Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Tingling in limbs, paranoia, irritability.
    
- Eye dilation with night-vision development.
    

**Stage II (6–18 hours):**

- Limb elongation, muscle reconfiguration for speed/agility.
    
- Claws begin to form; skin thickens into partial chitin plates.
    
- Saliva becomes mildly venomous (paralytic).
    

**Stage III (18–36 hours):**

- Spinneret organ develops (capable of producing binding webs).
    
- Split eyelids expand into 6–8 eyes for full 360° situational awareness.
    
- Venom potency increases — paralysis within seconds, death within minutes if untreated.
    

**Stage IV (36–48 hours):**

- Full Arachnis state: digitigrade stance, dual secondary limbs may sprout from thoracic region (variant-dependent).
    
- Capable of scaling walls and ceilings.
    
- Web silk strong enough to restrain armored soldiers or entrap machinery gears.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Urban Infiltration:** Silent population subjugation in enclosed environments.
    
- **Assassination/Removal:** Arachnids excel at eliminating leaders discreetly.
    
- **Terror Tactics:** Webbed streets, husked corpses, and ambush attacks destabilize morale.
    
- **Machine Disruption:** Silk can clog vents, optics, and moving components.

### **Containment Protocols**

- Resistant to most small-caliber weapons (chitin armor).
    
- Vulnerable to:
    
    - Fire/incendiaries.
        
    - Sonic disruptors (sensitivity to vibrations).
        
    - High-output UV light.
        
- Arachnis often build nests — localized hives can quickly overrun city blocks if not purged.

### **Operational Warnings**

- Arachnids exhibit solitary tendencies unless commanded; without UL override, they may cannibalize one another.
    
- Risk of population collapse if infestations are not kept strategically targeted.
    
- Silk byproducts may clog UL equipment if not properly filtered.
