**Designation:** Project: Amphibion Convergence
**Category:** Hybridization — Aquatic/Terrestrial Adaptation  
**Status:** Prototype Deployment

---

### **Overview**

Project: Amphibion Convergence is designed to create **adaptive, amphibious shock troops** capable of thriving in both aquatic and terrestrial theaters. Using **symbiotic bio-nanites**, amphibian DNA is introduced into hosts, triggering rapid physiological restructuring within **24–48 hours**.

The resulting hybrids retain full cognitive ability, but their instincts are reshaped toward **pack-based cooperation**, making them devastating in both coordinated assaults and guerrilla operations in swamps, rivers, or flooded cities.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Symbiotic bio-nanite infusion.
- **Delivery Systems:**
    - Waterborne nanite dispersal in rivers/lakes.
    - Aerosol misting in humid zones.

    - Direct nanite injection.
        
- **Latency:** Visible transformation begins within 8 hours, stabilizes within 48.

### **Infection Stages**

**Stage I (0–8 hours):**

- Skin moisture retention increases.
    
- Heightened olfactory and auditory sensitivity.
    
- Growing urge to seek water.
    

**Stage II (8–24 hours):**

- Development of semi-permeable, toxin-ready skin.
    
- Webbing begins forming between fingers/toes.
    
- Amphibious lung–gill crossover appears in ~40% of subjects.
    

**Stage III (24–36 hours):**

- Enhanced musculature for powerful leaps and swimming.
    
- Skin secretes mild toxins — irritants to most species, lethal in concentrated contact.
    
- Vocal sac-like organ allows deep resonance (used for communication or stunning prey).
    

**Stage IV (36–48 hours):**

- Fully Amphibion state:
    
    - Webbed extremities with claws for grip.
        
    - Semi-transparent nictitating membranes for underwater vision.
        
    - Cooperative hunting instinct—pack coordination similar to wolf behavior.
        
- Advanced toxin variants possible: paralysis, hallucinations, or organ failure.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Aquatic Infiltration:** Amphibions can patrol rivers, oceans, and underwater tunnels undetected.
    
- **Urban Flood Control:** Effective in flooded zones or sewers, where machines are unreliable.
    
- **Population Subversion:** Amphibions can release toxin secretions into reservoirs to weaken or pacify enemy populations.
    
- **Shock Troops:** Pack-hunting tactics overwhelm isolated units quickly.

### **Containment Protocols**

- Sensitive to dehydration — hostile dry environments weaken their physiology.
    
- Vulnerable to freezing temperatures.
    
- Toxins vary wildly between strains — UL handlers must catalog each pack’s biochemistry carefully.
    
- Amphibions instinctively form **hierarchies** — pack leaders must be identified and controlled to maintain order.

### **Operational Warnings**

- Symbiotic nanites may occasionally reject hosts with severe allergies, causing cellular meltdown.
    
- Amphibions show a tendency to establish “territories” near water bodies.
    
- If pack leaders are eliminated, groups may revert to feral, uncontrolled behavior.
