Designation: Project: Stormclaw Lynx
Category: Hybridization — Mountain & Extreme Terrain Recon Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**

Project: Stormclaw Lynx transforms hosts into hybrids derived from lynx and other mountain predators, optimized for high-altitude, rugged terrain, and extreme weather operations. These hybrids are agile, stealthy, and able to scale cliffs, leap across ravines, and survive in thin air and low temperatures.

---

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating lynx DNA sequences and high-altitude survival adaptations.  
Delivery: Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure in mountain-based UL testing zones.  
Latency: 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

---

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Minor physical adaptations: enhanced reflexes, balance, and grip strength.
    
- Fur begins growing along extremities; claws harden.
    
- Respiratory adaptations start for high-altitude oxygen efficiency.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Tail grows and becomes prehensile for balance.
    
- Limb musculature adjusts for climbing and leaping.
    
- Eye structure modifies for enhanced depth perception and low-light vision.
    

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**

- Full hybrid form realized:
    
    - Digitigrade legs for agility and speed on uneven terrain.
        
    - Fur pattern optimized for camouflage in rocky and snowy mountain zones.
        
    - Enhanced hearing and night vision.
        
    - Retains full human intelligence for strategy and reconnaissance coordination.

**Tactical Applications**

- **Reconnaissance:** Ideal for stealth infiltration in mountainous or rugged terrain.
    
- **Sabotage:** Capable of maneuvering in areas inaccessible to machines or traditional troops.
    
- **Survival Operations:** Can endure extreme temperatures and low-oxygen environments.
    
- **Pack Coordination:** Instinctively forms small teams to coordinate recon and sabotage missions.
    

---

**Control & Containment**

- Neural implants enable UL override via Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Hosts monitored to avoid excessive territorial aggression in populated or civilian areas.
    
- Nutritional requirements are moderate, optimized for endurance in extreme terrain.
    

---

**Psychological Notes**

- Heightened territorial instincts; may become aggressive if cornered or threatened.
    
- Increased independence may conflict with human social norms.
    
- Hunting and stealth instincts can dominate behavior during extended missions.

## Medium humanoid (hybrid), any alignment

Ability Score Increase

Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Age

Stormclaw Lynx hybrids complete the bulk of their physical transformation within a few days and reach maturity near the same age as humans. They typically live up to around 100–120 years in environments they’re adapted to; lifespans may shorten in low-altitude, high-pollution, or otherwise hostile regions.

Alignment

Stormclaw instincts favor practicality, independence, and territoriality. Many lean toward neutral or chaotic alignments, but Stormclaws can be lawful and cooperative when social bonds or mission rules require it.

Size

Stormclaw Lynx hybrids are Medium. Their lithe frames and digitigrade posture make them appear slightly taller at the hip than an unmodified human, but still within Medium size.

Speed

Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
You have a climb speed equal to 30 feet.

Traits

Darkvision. Accustomed to long, dim alpine twilight and cavernous ravines, you have darkvision out to 60 feet. You can see in dim light as if it were bright, and in darkness as if it were dim. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Talons. Your hands end (or can extend) into sharp talons. You can use them to make unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. When you make the Attack action with unarmed strikes using your talons, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.

Sure-Footed. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to climb, balance, or avoid being shoved or knocked prone while on uneven rocky or icy terrain. In such terrain you also ignore difficult terrain caused by loose rock, scree, or snow.

Mountain Endurance. Your physiology is tuned for thin air and severe cold. You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks to resist exhaustion or other harmful effects caused by high altitude, frigid temperatures, or reduced-oxygen environments. You also experience no penalties from up to two levels of exhaustion caused solely by cold/altitude once per long rest (GM adjudicates).

Tail Balance. You possess a prehensile tail built for balance. When you would fall and are conscious, you can use your reaction to reduce the falling damage you take by an amount equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier and land on your feet. Once you use this reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Keen Senses. You gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you already have proficiency in Perception, your proficiency bonus is doubled for Perception checks that rely on hearing or sight.

Camouflage. You have advantage on Wisdom (Stealth) checks when hiding or moving quietly in rocky, snowy, alpine, or mountainous terrain.

Pack Coordination. You are used to coordinating with fellow hunters. If at least one ally (any creature not incapacitated) is within 30 feet of you and you can see that ally, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, once per short rest when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can grant one ally within 5 feet of that creature advantage on their next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice (often a regional tongue, a mountain clan language, or a hybrid dialect used on UL outposts).
