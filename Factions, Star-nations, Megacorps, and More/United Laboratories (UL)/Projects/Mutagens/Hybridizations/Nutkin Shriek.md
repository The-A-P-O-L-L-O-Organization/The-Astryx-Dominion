Designation: Project: Nutkin Shriek 
Category: Hybridization — Stealth & Agility Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**

Project: Nutkin Shriek transforms hosts into squirrel-like hybrids, emphasizing speed, agility, and stealth. These hybrids are intended for reconnaissance, infiltration, and high-mobility operations in urban or forested environments.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating sciurid DNA sequences into host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.  
Latency: 4–8 hours for initial transformation.

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–4 hours):**
- Subtle physical adaptations: reduction in body size, slight digit modification, and minor fur growth.
- Enhanced reflexes and coordination begin to manifest.

**Stage II (4–8 hours):**
- Tail growth begins, bushy and expressive; limbs adapt for climbing and jumping.
- Hands and feet develop enhanced grip; ears elongate and become highly mobile.
- Eyes adjust for improved peripheral vision and night awareness.

**Stage III (8–24 hours):**
- Full squirrel hybrid form realized:
    - Small, lightweight body optimized for climbing, stealth, and quick movements.
    - Fur fully developed; tail functions as balance aid during agile maneuvers.
    - Neural enhancements increase spatial awareness, memory, and instinctive evasion skills.

Hosts retain near-human intelligence, allowing for tactical decision-making even at miniature scale.

**Tactical Applications**
- **Reconnaissance:** Small size allows for infiltration through tight spaces and undetected observation.
- **Sabotage:** Agile and stealthy — can disable systems or steal critical data with minimal detection.
- **Communication:** Capable of relaying observations quickly using enhanced spatial memory and sensory perception.
- **Urban/Forest Adaptation:** Excels in environments where mobility and height advantage are critical.

---

**Control & Containment**
- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
- Hosts require careful monitoring in high-traffic areas to avoid accidental detection.
- Nutritional needs are modest; metabolism is highly efficient to sustain small body size and high energy activity.

**Psychological Notes**
- Hyperactivity and curiosity can overwhelm untrained hosts.
- Natural squirrel instincts may conflict with human habits; careful conditioning is required.
- Strong survival instincts make hybrids highly adaptable in hostile environments.
