**Designation:** Project: Leviathan Ascend
**Category:** Hybridization — Bio-Siege & Environmental Manipulation Unit  
**Status:** Active Testing

### **Overview**

Project: Leviathan Ascend transforms hosts into **whale-like hybrids**, dramatically increasing their size, strength, and aquatic adaptability. These hybrids serve as **bio-siege units**, capable of dominating both aquatic and terrestrial environments for UL operations.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating cetacean DNA into host genome.
    
- **Delivery:** Injection, aerosolized mutagenic mist, or spire-mediated exposure.
    
- **Latency:** 12–24 hours for visible transformation.

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–12 hours):**

- Rapid growth begins; host size increases by 2–5× original height.
    
- Skeletal and muscular structures adapt to support massive frame.
    
- Partial dermal thickening occurs, providing aquatic resistance and enhanced durability.
    

**Stage II (12–24 hours):**

- Full whale hybrid morphology emerges:
    
    - Expanded torso and reinforced skeletal structure.
        
    - Partial fin-like appendages may appear on limbs; tail structures possible depending on mutation parameters.
        
    - Voice box and auditory system adapt for low-frequency communication and sonar capabilities.
        
- Intelligence largely retained; social instincts enhanced for coordinated group behaviors.
    

**Stage III (24 hours+):**

- Hosts reach maximum whale hybrid size: 6–10× original height depending on genetic parameters.
    
- Can generate aquatic propulsion and limited hydrokinetic effects (currents, waves) if submerged.
    
- Skin secretes biofilm or mutagenic compounds for controlled environmental influence.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Bio-Siege:** Physical dominance in enemy territories, capable of destroying fortifications or infrastructure.
    
- **Environmental Manipulation:** Control of aquatic regions, disruption of coastal or river-based logistics.
    
- **Psychological Warfare:** Massive size and hybrid form cause intimidation and chaos in enemy populations.

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural implants allow UL remote guidance and override via **Project: Override Spear** or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Growth stabilization protocols must be monitored to prevent structural collapse or host injury.
    
- High metabolic requirements; hosts require controlled environments or supplemental nutrition.

### **Psychological Notes**

- Hosts may feel alien due to extreme size and aquatic adaptations.
    
- Social integration with non-hybrid populations is impossible without UL-controlled zones.
    
- Cognitive abilities remain high, allowing tactical coordination in UL operations.
