**United Laboratories — Project File**  
**Designation:** Project: Vulpine Echo
**Category:** Hybridization — Stealth & Recon Unit  
**Status:** Active Testing

---

### **Overview**

Project: Vulpine Echo transforms hosts into **fox-like hybrids**, emphasizing **speed, stealth, and cunning**. These hybrids are intended for reconnaissance, infiltration, and sabotage operations in hostile territories.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating vulpine DNA sequences into host genome.
    
- **Delivery:** Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.
    
- **Latency:** 6–12 hours for initial transformation.
    

---

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Subtle physical adaptations: enhanced agility, reflexes, and minor facial reshaping.
    
- Slight fur growth begins along extremities; claws subtly lengthen.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Tail growth and fur density increase; ears elongate and become mobile for enhanced auditory perception.
    
- Limb musculature adjusts for speed and jumping capabilities.
    
- Eyes adapt for night vision and improved depth perception.
    

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**

- Full fox hybrid form realized:
    
    - Digitigrade legs for enhanced stealth movement.
        
    - Fur pattern and coloration may vary to optimize camouflage.
        
    - Neural enhancements increase strategic thinking, hunting instincts, and social coordination with other hybrids.
        
- Hosts retain near-full human intelligence, enabling complex mission planning.
    

---

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Reconnaissance:** Able to infiltrate enemy lines and remain undetected.
    
- **Sabotage:** Small, agile, and intelligent — ideal for subtle disruptions.
    
- **Espionage:** Capable of gathering information without alerting enemy personnel.
    
- **Pack Coordination:** Can operate in small teams using instinctive cooperative behavior guided by UL override signals.
    

---

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via **Override Spear** or Omega Prime clearance.
    
- Hosts require careful monitoring in urban or hazardous environments to avoid accidental discovery.
    
- Nutritional needs modest; highly efficient metabolism allows long-duration missions.
    

---

### **Psychological Notes**

- Enhanced sensory perception may overwhelm the host if untrained.
    
- Strong instincts toward stealth and hunting can create behavioral conflicts in normal society.
    
- Fox traits are psychologically reinforced; hosts may develop a “trickster” personality over time if not managed.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence or Charisma score increases by 1.

Age. Vulpine Echoes mature at a similar rate to humans but live slightly longer due to enhanced metabolism, averaging 120 years.

Alignment. Vulpine Echoes are naturally cunning and adaptable. Most lean toward chaotic alignments, but loyalty and intelligence make them versatile.

Size. Medium. Digitigrade legs may slightly change posture, but they are within Medium dimensions.

Speed. Base walking speed 35 ft.

Darkvision. Accustomed to nocturnal hunting, you can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

Stealthy Agility. You can take the Dash action as a bonus action once per short or long rest.

Fox’s Cunning. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Investigation, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.

Pack Coordination. When within 30 feet of at least one other Vulpine Echo or allied creature, you can communicate subtle intentions via gestures and expressions as a bonus action. This can be used to grant an ally within 30 feet advantage on one attack or skill check once per short or long rest.

Claws. You have retractable claws that deal 1d4 slashing damage. They count as natural weapons and can be used to make unarmed strikes.

Enhanced Reflexes. You may add your proficiency bonus to Dexterity saving throws once per short or long rest.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. You also know one additional language of your choice due to heightened intelligence and strategic thinking.

Subrace Options (Optional):

Urban Shade: Fur patterns and coloration optimized for camouflage in cities. Advantage on Stealth checks in urban or dim environments.

Forest Whisper: Fur patterns and coloration optimized for woodland areas. Can move stealthily through natural terrain without being slowed by difficult terrain.


Traits Summary: Vulpine Echoes are agile, clever, and stealthy humanoid hybrids. Their intelligence, pack coordination, and enhanced senses make them excellent scouts, spies, and infiltrators. Their fox-like instincts may make them mischievous or trickster-like in social situations.
