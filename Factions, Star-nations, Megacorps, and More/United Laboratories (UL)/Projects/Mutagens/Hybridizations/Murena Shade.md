Designation: Project: Murena Shade
Category: Hybridization — Aquatic Stealth & Sabotage Unit  
Status: Prototype Trials

---

**Overview**

Project: Murena Shade transforms hosts into eel-like aquatic hybrids, specialized for covert infiltration, underwater sabotage, and reconnaissance in maritime environments. The hybrid form emphasizes flexibility, camouflage, and rapid, serpentine movement through both open water and confined underwater spaces. Unlike bulkier marine hybrids, Murena Shade prioritizes stealth and precision in its operations.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Bioengineered viral construct integrating genetic sequences from moray eels and adaptive deep-sea species.  
Delivery: Injection or immersion in a UL nanofluid chamber.  
Latency: 6–10 hours for initial aquatic adaptation.

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–3 hours):**
- Host develops subtle dermal changes; skin becomes smoother and hydrodynamically optimized.
- Lungs partially adapt for dual respiration (air + water, via secondary gill structures).
- Enhanced oxygen retention increases underwater survivability.

**Stage II (3–7 hours):**
- Body elongates slightly, musculature restructures for serpentine locomotion.
- External gill structures manifest along the neck; eyes adapt to low-light underwater vision.
- Electrosensory nodes form along the body, allowing detection of vibrations and electronic signals.

**Stage III (7–10 hours):**
- Host fully transitions into hybrid form:
    - Streamlined, eel-like body with flexible spine for rapid underwater maneuvers.
    - Skin pigmentation shifts dynamically for camouflage in various aquatic environments.
    - Jaws strengthen with sharp dentition for defensive or offensive biting.
    - Capable of delivering bioelectric discharges for stunning prey or disrupting electronics.

**Tactical Applications**

- **Aquatic Infiltration:** Slips through tight spaces, pipes, and underwater conduits undetected.
    
- **Sabotage:** Uses bioelectric discharge to disable drones, mines, or underwater sensors.
    
- **Stealth Recon:** Camouflages against seabeds, reefs, and artificial structures while gathering intelligence.
    
- **Covert Exfiltration:** Moves silently and quickly through waterways to extract data or avoid pursuit.

**Control & Containment**

- Neural resonance implants allow UL tracking and limited override in aquatic zones.
    
- Hosts require periodic hydration to maintain skin integrity when operating on land.
    
- Transformation reverts within 12 hours post-mission, though prolonged aquatic exposure may accelerate re-emergence.

**Psychological Notes**

- Hybrid instincts may encourage ambush-style tactics, reinforcing stealth and patience.
    
- Host may experience lingering hydrophilia, preferring aquatic environments after reversion.
    
- Electrosensory enhancements may induce sensory overload if not carefully regulated.
