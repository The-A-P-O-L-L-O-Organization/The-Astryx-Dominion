**Designation:** Project: Terraform Strider
**Category:** Hybridization — Land Adaptation & Mobility Unit  
**Status:** Public Testing

---

### **Overview**

Project: Terraform Strider enhances hosts for land-based exploration, traversal, and physical resilience. The hybrid emphasizes agility, endurance, and survival in varied terrestrial environments. Features are designed for non-combat public applications, including ecological surveys, rugged terrain exploration, and emergency response in natural disasters.

### **Vector & Delivery**

**Vector:** Viral-genetic construct integrating reptilian and hoofed mammal DNA sequences.  
**Delivery:** Injection or aerosolized administration.  
**Latency:** 6–18 hours for initial transformation.

---

### **Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Musculoskeletal strengthening: legs elongate, muscles densify for endurance and speed.
    
- Skin develops enhanced toughness, minimal scales appear for durability.
    
- Mild discomfort reported during skeletal restructuring.
    

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**

- Development of **prehensile reptilian tail** for balance, manipulation, and agility.
    
- Hooves emerge, replacing previous foot structures, optimizing for rough terrain navigation.
    
- Posture and gait adjust to quadrupedal or semi-quadrupedal locomotion.
    

**Stage III (12–18 hours):**

- Full integration of tail and limb enhancements, allowing for advanced land mobility and stability.
    
- Neural adjustments optimize coordination and proprioception.
    
- Hosts retain full cognitive capacity, verbal communication, and public interaction ability.

### **Tactical & Public Applications**

- **Exploration & Surveying:** Efficient traversal of forests, mountains, and uneven terrain.
    
- **Emergency Response:** Rapid mobility and stability for search-and-rescue operations.
    
- **Public Demonstration:** Showcases UL’s safe hybridization technology in real-world environments.

### **Control & Containment**

- Neural interface optional for guided training or monitoring during public use.
    
- No aggressive behavioral modifications applied; hybrids retain autonomy and social faculties.
    
- Safety protocols ensure tail and hoof adaptations do not endanger the host or public.

### **Psychological & Social Notes**

- Minor initial discomfort during skeletal and muscular adaptation is normal.
    
- Public-facing subjects are encouraged to participate in acclimatization exercises.
    
- Hybridization is designed to maintain personality, social interaction, and human appearance where possible.
