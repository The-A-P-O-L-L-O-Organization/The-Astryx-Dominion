**Designation:** Project: Leonine Aspect  
**Category:** Hybridization Bio-Weaponization  
**Status:** Active Deployment Protocol Available

---

### **Overview**

Project: Leonine Aspect infuses target populations with leonid (lion-based) genetic and mutagenic modifications, rapidly transforming hosts into apex-predator shock troops within 48 hours. These “Leonids” exhibit pack-oriented behaviors, hyper-muscular frames, and predator-level senses, making them devastating in both open-field and urban combat.

Unlike Project: Draconis Veil, Leonids are **social hunters** — highly effective in coordinated strikes.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Bloodborne nanoplasmid mutagen (spread through aerosolized micro-needles or contaminated water supplies).
    
- **Delivery Systems:**
    
    - Drone mist dispersal.
        
    - Poisoned wells or reservoirs.
        
    - Targeted injection for elite conversion.
        
- **Latency:** Symptoms appear in 2–3 hours.

### **Infection Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**

- Heightened aggression, muscle tremors, and pupil dilation.
    
- Vocal cords begin to thicken, growl-like speech emerges.
    

**Stage II (6–24 hours):**

- Rapid muscle mass increase (+60–120%).
    
- Facial restructuring: jaw broadens, fangs erupt.
    
- Body hair thickens into mane-like growth patterns.
    

**Stage III (24–36 hours):**

- Heightened reflexes, hunting instincts.
    
- Formation of pride/pack hierarchies; Alphas naturally emerge.
    
- Roar development: concussive vocal bursts capable of stunning opponents within 10 meters.
    

**Stage IV (36–48 hours):**

- Full Leonid transformation.
    
- Digitigrade stance with clawed hands and feet.
    
- Enhanced stamina — capable of sprinting for hours without exhaustion.
    
- Instinctual pack cohesion allows for advanced coordinated attacks without explicit communication.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Pack Warfare:** Ideal for overrunning enemy outposts or military garrisons.
    
- **Rural/Frontier Control:** Effective against low-tech, spread-out populations.
    
- **Shock & Terror:** The sound of Leonid roars induces panic and disarray before physical engagement.

### **Containment Protocols**

- Leonids are highly resistant to small-arms fire, though they remain vulnerable to:
    
    - Long-range precision weapons.
        
    - Sonic disruptors (countering roar harmonics).
        
    - Neurotoxins tuned to predator biochemistry.
        
- Unchecked, packs may fragment into rival prides, leading to destabilization of entire regions.

### **Operational Warnings**

- Alphas may resist UL command signals if allowed to grow unchecked authority.
    
- Leonid ferocity can cause collateral damage — particularly to civilian infrastructure.
    
- Estimated 3% of hosts enter uncontrollable berserk states, tearing apart allies and enemies alike.
