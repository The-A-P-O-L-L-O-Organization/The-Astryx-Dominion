### Vector & Delivery

- **Vector:** Non-invasive viral-genetic construct designed to induce stickbug-like traits without severe physiological trauma.
    
- **Delivery:** Oral gel or dermal patch; no injections required.
    
- **Latency:** 24–48 hours for full effect.

### Transformation Stages

**Stage I (0–12 hours)**

- Minor elongation of fingers and toes, slight skin texturing.
    
- Subtle color shifts for improved blending with surroundings.
    
- Subject retains full mobility, comfort, and control.
    

**Stage II (12–24 hours)**

- Limbs elongate further within safe limits; prehensile ability begins.
    
- Camouflage patterns become adaptive, automatically shifting with surroundings.
    
- Heightened spatial awareness and balance, particularly when climbing.
    

**Stage III (24–48 hours)**

- Limb and torso morphology settle into final form.
    
- Full adaptive camouflage activated, allowing near-invisibility in natural environments.
    
- Neural adaptation ensures smooth coordination and minimal sensory overload.

### Tactical & Recreational Applications

- **Urban & Wilderness Stealth:** Blend with surroundings for photography, exploration, or personal enjoyment.
    
- **Aesthetic Appeal:** Unique stickbug morphology and natural camouflage patterns.
    
- **Environmental Interaction:** Prehensile grip and extended reach for climbing or navigating tricky terrain.

### Control & Safety

- **Fully Voluntary:** Participants can revert to normal form at any time with a simple antidote gel.
    
- **Minimal Distress:** Psychological and physiological safety is prioritized.
    
- **Supervision Optional:** Citizen users can monitor their own transformation via Nova interface.

### Psychological Notes

- Minor initial disorientation may occur during adaptation to new limb proportions.
    
- Users report **fun, creative, and empowering experiences** once acclimated.
    
- Training programs available for optimal stealth and balance usage.
