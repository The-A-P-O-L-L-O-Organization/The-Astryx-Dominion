Designation: Project: Medusian Echo 🪼  
Category: Hybridization — Stealth & Sensory Unit  
Status: Active Testing

---

**Overview**
Project: Medusian Echo transforms hosts into jellyfish-like hybrids, emphasizing stealth, environmental adaptability, and advanced sensory perception. These hybrids are intended for reconnaissance, infiltration, and covert observation in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.

**Vector & Delivery**
Vector: Viral-genetic construct incorporating jellyfish DNA and bioluminescent traits into host genome.  
Delivery: Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.  
Latency: 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

**Transformation Stages**
**Stage I (0–6 hours):**
- Slight body shrinkage and softening of tissues.
- Neural pathways adjust for enhanced detection of electromagnetic fields and environmental stimuli.
- Subtle translucence appears in extremities and skin.

**Stage II (6–12 hours):**
- Tentacle-like appendages form along arms and torso, capable of delicate manipulation or light stings.
- Skin develops semi-translucent, gelatinous texture; minor bioluminescent patterns begin to glow in low light.
- Host gains increased resistance to physical trauma due to flexible tissue and reduced density.

**Stage III (12–24 hours):**
- Full jellyfish hybrid form realized:
    - Body further condenses and becomes lightweight, allowing stealthy movement and swimming in aquatic or low-gravity environments.
    - Tentacles fully functional for manipulation, defense, or spreading UL-developed mutagenic agents.
    - Bioluminescence can be modulated for communication, distraction, or signaling.
    - Neural enhancements optimize environmental awareness, threat detection, and coordination with UL override signals.

Hosts retain intelligence but may experience sensory overload if untrained in high-stimulus areas.

**Tactical Applications**
- **Reconnaissance:** Stealthy infiltration in complex or aquatic environments.
- **Surveillance:** Bioluminescence can communicate silently or distract enemies.
- **Mutagen Deployment:** Tentacles capable of delivering UL-developed biological agents.
- **Stealth Operations:** Small size and flexible body allow access to restricted or hazardous zones.

---

**Control & Containment**
- Neural implants permit UL remote guidance and override via Project: Override Spear or Omega Prime clearance.
- Hosts require careful monitoring in populated areas to prevent accidental exposure to civilians.
- Metabolism adapted to sustain energy in low-nutrient environments while maintaining bioluminescence and tentacle activity.

**Psychological Notes**

- High sensory sensitivity may cause stress in chaotic environments.
- Tentacle-based locomotion and combat can feel unnatural initially.
- Host may develop heightened environmental empathy, affecting social behavior post-mission.
