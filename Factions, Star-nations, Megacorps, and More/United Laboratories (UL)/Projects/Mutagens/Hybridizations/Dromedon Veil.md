Designation: Project: Dromedon Veil
Category: Hybridization — Desert Endurance & Stealth Unit  
Status: Early Stage Field Trials

---

**Overview**

Project: Dromedon Veil enables the host to transform into a camel-inspired hybrid, scaled to their natural age. The design prioritizes long-term endurance, heat resistance, and desert stealth infiltration. Unlike smaller stealth hybrids, this form emphasizes survival in hostile arid climates while carrying significant biological storage capacity for water, nutrients, and equipment integration. The hybrid maintains intelligence, tactical awareness, and UL operability while disguised as a natural desert organism.

**Vector & Delivery**

Vector: Genetic-lattice viral carrier embedding camelid DNA with adaptive desert survival traits.  
Delivery: Injection or aerosolized nanite dust.  
Latency: 8–14 hours for full transformation depending on host size.

**Transformation Stages**

**Stage I (0–6 hours):**
- Dermal adaptation begins: thickened skin and heat-reflective pigmentation.
- Host begins gradual size increase, body adjusting to camel proportions relative to their current age.
- Early water-retention physiology appears in tissues.

**Stage II (6–10 hours):**
- Hump-like structures emerge, storing fat and water for extended endurance.
- Respiratory pathways adapt to minimize water loss while breathing in arid environments.
- Nasal structures shift, allowing sand filtration.
- Eyes develop protective membranes to withstand dust storms.

**Stage III (10–14 hours):**
- Full camel-hybrid form realized:
    - Large, desert-adapted body scaled to the host’s natural growth stage.
    - Internal hydration reserves capable of sustaining the host for weeks without external supply.
    - Hoof and limb adaptations for silent, steady traversal of sand, dunes, and rocky terrain.
    - Neural adaptations allow the hybrid to retain stealth instincts despite size, blending into herds or desert terrain.

**Tactical Applications**
- **Desert Infiltration:** Blends seamlessly with natural desert wildlife, minimizing suspicion.
- **Endurance Recon:** Operates for long durations without supply drops or hydration.
- **Cargo Hybrid:** Capable of carrying gear, data caches, or hidden UL equipment across vast distances.
- **Nomadic Espionage:** Disguises as ordinary livestock, allowing entry into guarded desert regions.

---

**Control & Containment**
- Neural implants synced with UL’s Override Spear ensure obedience even during large-scale operations.
- Due to host size increase, containment requires reinforced stasis pods and desert-grade enclosures.
- Hydration reserves must be monitored; dehydration may trigger aggressive, survival-driven instincts.

---

**Psychological Notes**
- Hosts may experience disorientation due to drastic size shift and altered locomotion.
- Instincts for endurance and slow, cautious behavior may conflict with mission urgency.
- Transformation carries a high sense of resilience and patience, but hosts often develop discomfort in non-desert environments post-reversion.

Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Age
Dromedon Veil hybrids mature rapidly, completing their transformation within days. They live as long as their base species normally would, but many do not survive long in non-arid environments due to physiological stress.

Alignment
The endurance-focused instincts of Dromedon Veil push them toward neutrality. Some adopt lawful alignments, valuing structure and cooperation, while others fall to chaotic neutral, roaming like wild nomads.

Size
Large. Dromedon Veil hybrids increase in size, typically standing 7–10 feet tall and weighing 400–800 pounds depending on their original age and build.

Speed
Your base walking speed is 35 ft.
You can also travel for twice as long as other humanoids before suffering exhaustion from marching or carrying loads.

Traits

Heat Resilience
You have resistance to fire damage and advantage on saving throws against exhaustion caused by extreme heat.

Hydration Reserve
You can go without water for up to 10 days, drawing on internal reserves. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest and drink at least a gallon of water.

Sandstrider’s Step
You ignore difficult terrain caused by sand, dust, or loose earth.

Enduring Bulk
Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled. You also count as one size larger when determining the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Nomadic Patience
You have proficiency in the Survival skill. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track creatures or forage in desert environments.

Thickened Hide
Your skin grants you natural protection. While unarmored, your AC equals 12 + your Constitution modifier.

Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice (often Desert Cant, Draconic, or Primordial).
