**Designation:** Project: Felis Whisper 🐈  
**Category:** Hybridization — Stealth & Agility Unit  
**Status:** Active Testing

---

### **Overview**

Project: Felis Whisper transforms hosts into cat-like hybrids, emphasizing stealth, reflexes, and acute sensory perception. These hybrids are intended for reconnaissance, infiltration, and rapid-response operations in urban, forested, or complex terrain environments. The host’s size reduces to roughly that of a typical domestic cat of their age.

### **Vector & Delivery**
- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating feline DNA sequences into the host genome.
- **Delivery:** Injection, aerosolized spores, or spire-mediated exposure.
- **Latency:** 4–10 hours for initial transformation.

---

### **Transformation Stages**
**Stage I (0–4 hours):**
- Host begins gradual size reduction.
- Subtle sensory enhancements: improved night vision, acute hearing, and olfactory sensitivity.

**Stage II (4–8 hours):**
- Fur begins to develop along extremities; whiskers appear for tactile navigation.
- Musculature adjusts for agility, balance, and silent movement.
- Tail growth for enhanced balance.

**Stage III (8–24 hours):**
- Full Felis Whisper form realized:
    - Size approximately that of a domestic cat of the host's age.
    - Digitigrade limbs optimized for stealthy, quiet movement.
    - Retractable claws for climbing, defense, and dexterous manipulation.
    - Neural adaptations heighten reflexes, spatial awareness, and hunting instincts while retaining near-full human intelligence.

---

### **Tactical Applications**
- **Infiltration:** Able to access tight spaces or high vantage points unnoticed.
- **Reconnaissance:** Ideal for stealth observation and intelligence gathering.
- **Sabotage:** Can manipulate objects, sabotage equipment, or disable mechanisms discreetly.
- **Rapid Evacuation:** Small size allows for swift extraction through compact or narrow routes.

---

### **Control & Containment**
- Neural implants allow UL remote guidance and override via **Project: Override Spear** or **Omega Prime clearance**.
- Must monitor for environmental hazards due to smaller size.
- Nutritional needs scaled to host’s reduced mass and energy expenditure.

---

### **Psychological Notes**
- Hosts may display **increased curiosity and hunting behaviors**, which require training for mission focus.
- Social behavior may shift, including preference for isolated or high-ground positions.
- Retention of human intelligence allows for complex mission planning, but instincts can occasionally override strategic thinking under stress.
