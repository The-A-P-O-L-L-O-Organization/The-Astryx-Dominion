**United Laboratories — Project File**  
**Designation:** Project: Pachyderm Codex 🐘  
**Category:** Hybridization — Heavy Siege Adaptation  
**Status:** Prototype Deployment

---

### **Overview**

Project: Pachyderm Codex introduces **pachyderm-derived traits** into human and animal hosts, producing **massive, resilient siege organisms**. Through **foodborne genetic modifiers**, subjects undergo rapid skeletal reinforcement, dermal thickening, and muscular hypertrophy.

The result is a towering hybrid: less agile, but nearly indestructible in direct combat. These hybrids instinctively form **herds** and can be directed via **UL neural control signals**, making them ideal for both **siege warfare** and **labor deployment** in hostile or resource-scarce environments.

### **Vector & Delivery**

- **Vector:** Foodborne genetic modifier complexes.
    
- **Delivery Systems:**
    
    - Grain or fodder-based supplements.
        
    - Water soluble packets.
        
    - Emergency rations with disguised compounds.
        
- **Latency:** Transformation completes in **36–48 hours**.

### **Infection Stages**

**Stage I (0–12 hours):**

- Surge in caloric demand, compulsive eating.
    
- Thickening of epidermis begins.
    
- Hosts display lethargy but rising aggression.
    

**Stage II (12–24 hours):**

- Skeletal system begins to enlarge and densify.
    
- Muscle mass expands by 50–80%.
    
- Subjects begin forming small herd-like groups instinctively.
    

**Stage III (24–36 hours):**

- Full pachyderm musculature with extended limbs.
    
- Trunk-like nasal extensions develop in ~40% of hosts.
    
- Skin becomes leathery and resistant to small arms fire.
    

**Stage IV (36–48 hours):**

- Complete **Pachyderm State**:
    
    - Height increased by 0.5–1.5 meters.
        
    - Skin density comparable to light armor plating.
        
    - Endurance increased—hybrids can march for days without fatigue.
        
    - Strength levels sufficient to crush barriers, overturn armored vehicles, or carry heavy war materiel.

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Siege Warfare:** Breaks through fortifications and urban defenses.
    
- **Shock and Awe:** Sheer size and power demoralize populations.
    
- **Labor Deployment:** Can be harnessed for large-scale construction or demolition.
    
- **Zone Domination:** Herd behavior makes them effective at holding ground en masse.
    

---

### **Containment Protocols**

- Agility loss makes them vulnerable to high-speed aerial or precision strikes.
    
- Herding instinct means they follow a dominant leader—**control that leader, and the herd follows**.
    
- Excessive hunger makes them dependent on UL-supplied rations, a built-in control method.
    
- Neural pattern embedding ensures UL override, but corruption of signals can lead to rampaging behavior.
    

---

### **Operational Warnings**

- Host body mass increases may rupture pre-existing weak cardiovascular systems.
    
- If not properly controlled, Pachyderms may cause **indiscriminate destruction**, including UL assets.
    
- Herd stampedes can destabilize entire cities if directed without precision.

## Large humanoid (hybrid), any alignment

---

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Age. Pachyderm Codex hybrids mature at the same rate as humans but live slightly longer, typically 120–150 years.

Alignment. Due to herd instincts, most lean toward lawful or neutral alignments, often prioritizing group cohesion and obedience to a dominant leader.

Size. Large. Pachyderm Codexes gain +1 size category, with bulkier frames and increased reach.

Speed. Base walking speed 30 ft.

Natural Armor. Your leathery, thickened skin grants you an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Trunk (Optional). Approximately 40% of Pachyderm Codexes develop a prehensile trunk, usable for lifting, grappling, or interacting with objects (can lift up to 50 lbs. easily).

Siege Strength. You can add your Strength modifier to damage rolls with unarmed strikes and improvised melee attacks (in addition to normal weapon bonuses).

Herd Instinct. When within 30 feet of an allied Pachyderm Codex or creature you recognize as a leader, you may use a reaction to grant advantage to an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check once per short or long rest.

Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Thick Skin. You have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning damage.

Endurance. You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. You also know one additional language of your choice.

Subrace Options (Optional):

Trunked Codex: Prehensile trunk allows for additional attack or utility actions.

Hulking Codex: Extra muscle mass increases carrying capacity and damage, but reduces speed by 5 ft.
