**Designation:** Project: Sirenia Shift
**Category:** Hybridization — Aquatic Transformation & Gender Modulation  
**Status:** Active Development

---

### Overview

Project: Sirenia Shift transforms hosts into aquatic-adapted hybrids capable of thriving in both underwater and coastal environments. A notable effect of this hybridization is the modulation of the host’s gender, often resulting in the host becoming female, though the underlying biological mechanisms are still under study.

This hybridization emphasizes graceful aquatic movement, enhanced swimming efficiency, and sensory adaptations for deep-water environments.

### Vector & Delivery

- **Vector:** Viral-genetic construct incorporating human and aquatic adaptations.
    
- **Delivery:** Injection or spire-mediated immersion.
    
- **Latency:** 6–12 hours for initial transformation.

### Transformation Effects

- Development of full aquatic tail, webbed hands and feet.
    
- Modification of skeletal and muscular systems for fluid underwater locomotion.
    
- Aquatic respiratory adaptation: gills and enhanced lung efficiency.
    
- Enhanced sensory perception for underwater navigation and prey detection.
    
- Hormonal and reproductive modulation leading to consistent feminization in most hosts.

### Tactical & Practical Applications

- Aquatic exploration and mapping in deep-sea or alien oceanic environments.
    
- Underwater reconnaissance and stealth missions.
    
- Environmental adaptability for mixed terrestrial and aquatic colonies.

### Control & Containment

- Neural implants allow UL oversight and guidance, with safety overrides for deep-water operations.
    
- Monitoring required for psychological adaptation to gender changes and aquatic physiology.
    
- Nutritional needs adjusted to support high-efficiency metabolism and muscular development.

### Psychological & Social Notes

- Hosts may experience identity adjustment due to gender modulation.
    
- Aquatic instincts are heightened, with an innate preference for swimming and submerged environments.
    
- Careful psychological support is recommended to integrate hybrid physiology and gender effects.
