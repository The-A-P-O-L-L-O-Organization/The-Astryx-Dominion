### **Overview**

Project: Aetherwing is a one-rider personal transport unit engineered for **air, land, and aquatic traversal**, with limited near-orbital capability when upgraded. Designed for rapid deployment, recon, and insertion/extraction missions, the vehicle integrates adaptive hover systems, sealed environment shielding, and UL’s _Bio-Respiratory Envelope_ technology to sustain riders across hostile environments.

Base models are optimized for **terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic** conditions. UL does not recommend orbital or deep-space use without the **Vacuum Adaptation Upgrade**, which adds life support stabilization, radiation shielding, and micrometeoroid protection.

### **Technical Specifications**

- **Core Frame:** Ultralight alloy skeleton with adaptive stabilization fins.
    
- **Propulsion Systems:**
    
    - **Hover Arrays:** Antigrav impellers for ground and low-altitude flight (max 150 mph).
        
    - **Atmospheric Jets:** Microthrusters for high-altitude maneuvering (max altitude ~20,000 ft).
        
    - **Hydro-Drive Conversion:** Sealed intake/exhaust turbines allow full underwater mobility (up to 100 mph, depth rating 1,000 ft).
        
- **Environment Envelope:**
    
    - Generates a **Bio-Respiratory Field** around the rider.
        
    - Filters toxins, hydrates air, equalizes pressure, and allows underwater breathing.
        
    - Limited oxygen recycling: safe for ~72 hours continuous use.
        
- **Control Interface:**
    
    - Neural-link handlebars with manual override.
        
    - Optional **Queue-Link Socket** for hybrid users.
        
    - Integrated HUD projected on rider’s visor/helm.

### **Upgrades**

**Vacuum Adaptation Package (UL Model-V):**

- Expands envelope to fully seal against vacuum.
    
- Adds thermal regulation, radiation shielding, and 48-hour oxygen cycle.
    
- Micro-fusion thrusters allow limited orbital maneuvering (max delta-v ~2 km/s).
    
- Warning: _Extended exposure to open-space conditions without this upgrade may result in catastrophic system failure and rider mortality._

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Rapid Insertion:** Deploy from ships or high cliffs into hostile terrain.
    
- **Aquatic Recon:** Stealth submersion for infiltration and retrieval missions.
    
- **Aerial Strike:** High-speed maneuvers for scouting or dogfighting.
    
- **Escape & Evacuation:** Emergency extraction under almost any conditions.

### **Control & Containment**

- Requires trained neural acclimation; unlinked riders may experience vertigo.
    
- Envelope induces mild sensory distortion when submerged for extended durations (>6 hrs).
    
- Not rated for direct hybrid carriage — single rider only.

### **Psychological Notes**

- Riders describe the envelope as “like breathing through liquid glass.”
    
- Prolonged use may cause dependency — subjects report feeling “exposed” without it.
    
- Some riders experience a sense of _oneness_ with the vehicle, bordering on symbiosis.
