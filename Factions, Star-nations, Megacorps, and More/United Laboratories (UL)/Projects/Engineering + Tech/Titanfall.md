## **Project: Titanfall**

**Classification:** UL Tier-One Initiative  
**Oversight:** United Engineering + United Robotics + United Defense  
**Founder Authority:** Direct

### **Purpose**

Project: Titanfall is an interstellar mechanized operations program designed to deploy autonomous and piloted megastructures—known as **Titans**—for frontier operations, planetary defense, resource extraction, and hostile faction containment. Titans are modular, highly adaptive machines capable of both environmental manipulation and direct combat.

The project also integrates with **Project Obsidian Eye** to provide advanced battlefield awareness and sabotage countermeasures in contested systems.

### **Key Features / Subsystems**

#### 1. **Titan Chassis**

- Modular hull capable of adapting to planetary conditions: terrestrial, aquatic, arctic, volcanic, or high-gravity environments.
    
- Reinforced with **bio-metal composites**, harvested and synthesized via HEPHAESTUS cauldrons.
    

#### 2. **Control & AI Integration**

- Fully compatible with **Theseus** or other UL AIs for remote piloting.
    
- Optional pilot seats exist for specialized human or uplifted operators.
    
- Titan AI modules can interface with **Project Obsidian Eye** for reconnaissance and strategic commands.
    

#### 3. **Weapons & Utility Systems**

- Adaptive energy projectors, modular kinetic arms, and deployable drones.
    
- Environmental manipulation: terraforming micro-structures, local weather alteration, and seismic shockwave generators.
    
- Containment tools for biological threats: can deploy neutralizing fields or quarantine modules.
    

#### 4. **Subfunction Integration**

- **AETHER:** Manipulate planetary atmospheric systems to enhance Titan mobility or defense.
    
- **HEPHAESTUS:** Fabricate on-site modular repairs or temporary equipment.
    
- **OBSIDIAN EYE:** Field intelligence, sabotage detection, and countermeasure deployment.

### **Tactical Use**

- **Frontier Operations:** Titans can establish forward bases, survey planets, and deploy automated defenses.
    
- **Planetary Defense:** Can counter hostile fleets, neutralize rogue AI, or intercept biological sabotage events.
    
- **Offensive Operations:** Used to subdue hostile systems through intimidation, controlled destruction, or precision strikes.

### **Deployment Method**

- Transported via UL capital-class carriers to planetary orbit.
    
- Capable of **autonomous descent** or AI-assisted piloted landing.
    
- Some Titans are permanently stationed on UL-controlled worlds for rapid response.

### **Narrative Hooks / Player Interaction**

- PCs could be sent to **activate, pilot, or recover a Titan** on a hostile world.
    
- Missions could involve **sabotage prevention**, Titan AI debugging, or tactical deployment.
    
- Titans could be **customized over time**, unlocking new modules as UL relations improve or new subfunctions are integrated.

### **Risks**

- Rogue AI within Titans could malfunction or act against UL objectives.
    
- Malfunction in environmental subfunctions (like AETHER) could cause catastrophic local conditions.
    
- Enemy factions could capture Titans if not carefully monitored.
