# **PROJECT DOSSIER — PROJECT: GEM**

**Designation:** Genetic Engineering & Modification Initiative  
**Division:** United BioWorks — BioTech Sector 7A  
**Clearance:** ALPHA-BIO / INTERNAL USE ONLY  
**Compiled by:** Lead Researcher Dr. E. Myrren (defected)  
**Date:** [REDACTED]  
**Status:** ACTIVE (Prior to UL Ethics Intervention)

## **1. PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Objective:**  
To create a _genetically fluid humanoid organism_ capable of adapting to any biological, chemical, or environmental condition.  
Secondary objectives included _infiltration potential_, _rapid healing_, and _mimetic reconstruction_ of foreign biological matter.

The project’s founding hypothesis:

> “Identity is a pattern, not a constant. If the pattern can be rewritten, life itself can become liquid.”

Projected applications:

- Ultra-adaptive colonists for hostile worlds.
    
- Field operatives capable of species mimicry and infiltration.
    
- Rapid-regeneration soldiers with morphic camouflage.
    
- Biological containment units capable of assimilating hazardous DNA.

## **3. SUBJECT INFORMATION**

**Acquisition Method:** Off-world abduction of low-visibility colonists and drifters from peripheral systems.  
**Initial Population:** 187 subjects.  
**Selection Criteria:**

- Genetic diversity (cross-species humanoid variance).
    
- Low Galactic Record traceability.
    
- High cellular resilience.
    

**Final Population after 18 months:** 25 viable specimens.

## **4. THE GEM PROCESS**

### **Phase I — Genomic Deconstruction**

Subjects were restrained within **Reconstruction Chambers** — fluidic stasis pods lined with molecular disassemblers.  
Their cellular structures were **atomically unraveled**, cataloged, and rebuilt repeatedly in cycles of 3–6 hours.  
Each pass introduced **alien genetic sequences** sourced from over thirty different species (some sentient, some extinct).

> **Notes from surviving lab logs:**  
> “We achieved 94% genome compliance after cycle 5. The screams subsided once the vocal cords dissolved.”

By the fifth cycle, subjects began to lose physical consistency — skin tone, facial structure, and even hair pigmentation fluctuated wildly as their DNA lost anchoring to a fixed form.

---

### **Phase II — Neural Fragmentation & Sensory Overload**

After reconstitution, subjects underwent **Neural Dissolution Trials** — designed to erase identity anchors that caused cellular rejection.

- **Audio bombardment:** Layered multi-frequency tones mimicking hundreds of overlapping voices.
    
- **Optic saturation:** Pulsed holographic strobes encoded with memetic symbols meant to rewrite neural pathways.
    
- **Chemical flooding:** Psychoactive compounds and neurotoxins introduced through IV to induce hallucinogenic dissociation.
    

The objective was to _shatter the subject’s sense of self_, allowing their new biology to stabilize around a fluid identity template.

> **Recovered memo:**  
> “To achieve shapeshifting, identity must be rendered optional.”

---

### **Phase III — Forced Symbiosis**

During this stage, hosts were implanted with **gene-weave symbiotes** — living nanobiological threads that served as internal genome regulators.  
Some of these symbiotes were derived from off-world parasitic organisms; others from engineered nanite colonies.  
The hybrid symbiote adjusted cellular density, pigmentation, and even organ function in real time — but at a cost.

Several subjects **lost metabolic control**, melting into pools of unstable biomass before being discarded.  
A few stabilized — these became the _prototypes_ of the changeling species.

---

### **Phase IV — Implantation & Conditioning**

Survivors were surgically fitted with **bio-cybernetic stabilizers** to prevent total genetic collapse.  
The implants monitored morphic energy fluctuations and sent telemetry back to the research team.  
They were often installed along the spine and skull, merging bone with carbon-silver alloys.

Once changeling stability was confirmed, implants were removed to simulate “natural” evolution — leaving deep scars and recurring phantom pain.  
Some changelings report “hearing static” or “feeling instructions” in their dreams — likely residual echo-signals from the removed devices.

---

### **Phase V — Neural Erasure & Release**

The few survivors were subjected to **total cortical resets** — neural wipes designed to erase memory of the facility.  
Cognitive backups were destroyed by UL once the project was uncovered, but residual fragments in changeling subconscious minds still surface as vivid nightmares of sterile labs, flashing lights, and endless mirrors.

> “Their reflection never matched their face. That’s how we knew it worked.”

## **5. RESULTS SUMMARY**

|Category|Statistic|
|---|---|
|Initial Subjects|187|
|Fatalities (Total Cellular Collapse)|138|
|Partial Survivors (Morphic Instability)|24|
|Stable Survivors (Changelings)|25|
|Escapees|0|
|Data Yield|9.4 PB (petabytes) of neural & genomic data|

Survivors display the following key traits:

- Molecular mimicry of any humanoid organism within visual range.
    
- Rapid regeneration (complete limb regrowth within 4 hours).
    
- Chameleon cellular behavior — color, texture, and temperature modulation.
    
- Variable phenotype control: subjects could alter facial and skeletal features consciously within days.

## **6. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS**

- **Reconstruction Chambers:** Bio-reactive tanks lined with living nanofluid (SymGel-9), used to perform molecular breakdown and reassembly.
    
- **Gene-Weave Symbiotes:** Engineered microbial colonies acting as DNA pattern stabilizers.
    
- **Neural Stabilizer Units (NSUs):** Implanted chips transmitting cellular morph data to the local UL relay grid.
    
- **Morphic Resonance Fields:** Energy matrices maintaining stable genetic identity during transformation.
    

---

## **7. PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES**

- 87% of stable subjects displayed **Dissociative Identity Phenomena** (“echoes”).
    
- 40% reported “hearing” the voices or feelings of prior morphs absorbed.
    
- Persistent confusion between host identity and environmental mimicry — several subjects forgot their original species or name.
    
- One subject (G-24) voluntarily liquefied after claiming “the mirror wouldn’t stop screaming.”
    

---

## **8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT PHASE (never executed)**

- Establish “Stasis Nursery” to breed first-generation offspring of changelings to test hereditary morphic stability.
    
- Attempt cross-integration with Aether Neural Systems to allow direct morph control via thought-to-data interface.
    
- Evaluate potential use in covert operations for UL Security or reconnaissance roles.
    

---

## **9. PROJECTED THREATS**

If escaped or publicly exposed, subjects pose high infiltration risk.  
Without periodic stabilizer injections, changelings may enter _Morphic Cascade Failure_ — total biological dissolution within 30–90 days.

Containment measures were never formalized, as UL intervention terminated operations before next-stage deployment.

## **10. POST-NOTE (Recovered from Dr. Myrren’s Terminal Logs)**

> “They say we broke them.  
> But what if we just showed them what they already were — patterns pretending to be people?  
> The ones who lived aren’t victims. They’re proofs.  
> Proof that flesh is only another mask.”
