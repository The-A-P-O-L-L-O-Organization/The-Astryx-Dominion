# PROJECT: AEONBORN
### **Objective**

To create a **fully sentient species** engineered for extreme adaptability, intelligence, and capability:

- All individuals are **naturally in Omega Form** (customizable V3 baseline).
- Chimeric Genesis injection traits are **fully integrated**, allowing advanced hybrid abilities.
- Designed to operate across **any environment, planetary or extra-dimensional**.
- Capable of **self-evolution and adaptive problem-solving** beyond conventional limits.

### **Key Features**

1. **Physical & Environmental Adaptation**
    - Natural wings, prehensile tails, aquatic and terrestrial adaptability.
    - Full bio-armor, regenerative tissue, and adaptive sensory organs.
    - Can survive vacuum, extreme radiation, and high-gravity environments.
    
2. **Cognitive & Psionic Capacity**
    - Integrated psionic and neural interface compatibility.
    - Advanced memory, intelligence, and multi-dimensional perception.
    - Capable of learning and evolving at speeds far beyond standard species.
    
3. **Hybrid Traits**
    - Chimeric Genesis-derived enhancements from galaxy-spanning species.
    - Genetic stability safeguards to prevent self-destructive mutations.
    - Optional: species-wide telepathic or hive-mind links for coordinated operations.
    
4. **Longevity & Reproduction**
    - Biological lifespan enhanced via Omega Form cellular regeneration.
    - Rapid maturation cycles to quickly establish viable populations.
    - Controlled reproductive protocols ensure genetic integrity and expansion.
