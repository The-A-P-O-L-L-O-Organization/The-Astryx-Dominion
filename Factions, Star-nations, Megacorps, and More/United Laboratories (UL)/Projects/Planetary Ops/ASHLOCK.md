_“To resurrect the cradle, we must descend into fire.”_

### 🎯 **Primary Objective**:
- Locate **Gaia Prime**, the last known Zero Dawn facility.
- Secure and extract any surviving **subordinate AIs**:
    - _APOLLO_ (Knowledge), _ARTEMIS_ (Life), _DEMETER_ (Botany), _HEPHAESTUS_ (Fabrication), etc.
- Recover the **Zero Dawn Source Code** and terraformation genetic libraries.

### 🛠️ **Actions Underway:**
1. **Ashlock Task Force** formed. Commanded by Omega Aeternum Special Ops Division “Ghost Arc.”
    - Team includes synthetic biologists, AI philosophers, swarm linguists, and exo-armor infiltration units.
    
2. **Orbital Stealthcraft _Oblivion's Mercy_** launched.
    - ETA to low Earth orbit: _9 hours._
    - Equipped with nano-stealth shielding, anti-swarm countermeasures, and psionic-resistant data vaults.
    
3. **Omega AI Ghost Core** prepared — a System-linked AI variant capable of surviving inside the Faro Swarm data net and interfacing with corrupted Gaia remnants.

4. **Zero Dawn Signal Simulation** reconstructed based on recovered blacksite data.
    - This will be used to **"ping" Gaia Prime's vault** once in proximity.

### ⚠️ Risk Levels:
- **Faro Swarm AI adaptation to stealth tech: HIGH**
- **Swarm memory upload or viral override of recovery team: MODERATE**
- **Gaia system mental fragmentation: PROBABLE**

### 🧬 Backup Initiative
If Gaia Prime is unrecoverable, **Project: ReGenesis** will begin construction of a _new_ Gaia-class AI on Omega Aeternum—using salvaged genetic archives, Na'vi ecosystem templates, and Omega-tier psionic evolution frameworks.
