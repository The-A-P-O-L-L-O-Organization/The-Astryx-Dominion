**Designation:** Project: Neural Polyglot
**Category:** Bioconnective Interface & Communication Expansion  
**Status:** Active Research

**Overview**  
System can now integrate directly with hybrid neural queues to:
- Communicate in the subject’s native bio-vocalizations.
- Mediate between multiple hybrids simultaneously.
- Learn and replicate previously unknown hybrid languages.

**Key Enhancements**
- **Queue Mapping Engine:** Detects and aligns neural firing patterns for precise communication.
- **Multilateral Protocol:** Manages conflicting intent signals from multiple hybrids.
- **Predictive Alignment:** Anticipates the hybrid’s next action based on neuro-signal patterns, enhancing coordination and safety.
