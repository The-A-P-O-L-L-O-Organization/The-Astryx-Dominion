### **United Laboratories — Project File**

**Designation:** Project: Cognitive Flexion  
**Category:** Adaptive Learning & Autonomy  
**Status:** Prototype Trials

**Overview**  
System’s AI can now restructure its cognitive architecture on the fly to:
- Handle multi-tasking across unrelated domains.
- Run scenario simulations at varying levels of fidelity.
- Maintain redundancy for critical decision-making during emergencies.

**Key Enhancements**
- **Decision Matrix Reconfiguration:** AI can prioritize human, hybrid, or environmental safety dynamically.
- **Learning Acceleration:** Novel experiences (like Zephyr’s mischief) automatically optimize future responses.
- **Ethical Overlay Module:** Embeds complex ethical reasoning for high-stakes decisions, tied to UL Ethics Committee protocols.
