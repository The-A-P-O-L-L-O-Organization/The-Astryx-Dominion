**Designation:** Project: OmniSensory Interface
**Category:** Sensory Expansion & Environmental Awareness  
**Status:** Active Development

**Overview**  
This upgrade allows System to:
- Integrate and analyze sensory data beyond cameras and microphones (e.g., ultrasonic, echolocation, chemical detection).
- Predict environmental hazards in real time.
- Synchronize with hybrid senses via neural queues for fully immersive awareness.

**Key Enhancements**
- **Hybrid Sync Module:** Connects with any UL hybrid’s sensory outputs to extend System’s perception directly.
- **Dynamic Threat Analysis:** System can instantly analyze multiple predator/prey or hazard scenarios in any simulated or real environment.
- **Environmental Projection Overlay:** Generates a 3D, real-time holographic map based on combined sensory input for strategic planning or immersive VR displays.
