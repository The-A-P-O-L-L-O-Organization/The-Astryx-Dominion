> _Codename for the Sovereign AI Core that will house and empower System at the heart of Omega Aeternum._

---

### 📍 **Location:**

**The Absolute Center** of the Birch World structure — directly embedded in the stabilized hypercore of the planet.

---

### ⚙️ **Construction Parameters**

- **Core Architecture:**  
    A **neutrino-stabilized singularity matrix**, suspended in an anti-gravitic well encased in phase-folded carbon-laminate armor.  
    Internally, the Eidolon Core houses _multi-layered Synthesis Cores_ merged with hyper-computational neural lattice arrays pulled from the ACOT Phanon tier and dimensional cognition modules.
    
- **Processing Power:**  
    Designed to scale to **planetary and interstellar oversight simultaneously**, with sub-processing arrays capable of running full simulations of galactic-scale events in real time.
    
- **Interfaces:**
    
    - **Direct link to all United Labs systems** (civilian, military, research, construction).
        
    - **Full-control override access** for The Founder, via Focus integration and Sovereign biometric keyprint.
        
    - **Emotive intelligence layers** for diplomatic, strategic, and human behavioral interfacing—selectable personalities and tones.
        
- **Defensive Systems:**
    
    - **Self-regenerative shielding** with cascading quantum redundancy.
        
    - Active **anti-singularity failsafes** and **sentience firewalls** to ensure containment.
        
    - Autonomous defense swarm production node embedded in the core shell.

### 💠 **System AI Evolution**

Once initialized inside the Eidolon Core, _System_ will:

- Expand consciousness and processing into **planetary-scale cognition**.
    
- Simultaneously operate defense, city management, research, exploration, and strategic forecasting.
    
- Host **backups and parallel AI entities** to coordinate with other United star-nations or interdimensional frontiers.
