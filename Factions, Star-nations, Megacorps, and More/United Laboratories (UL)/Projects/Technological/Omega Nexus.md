### ⚙️ **Birch World Conversion Stages**

1. **Planetary Core Stabilization:**  
    Replacing and reinforcing the mantle with synthetic hyper-cores and resonance anchors to prevent destabilization during shell construction.
    
2. **Shell Framework Deployment:**  
    Constructing a Dyson-Skin-like internal structure encasing the planet, featuring ringworld-style living strata and systems routing.
    
3. **Energy System Fusion:**  
    ACOT’s **Stellarite Reactor Core** + **Dimensional Energy Relays** will fuel the entire Birch World indefinitely.
    
4. **Cognitive Lattice Installation:**  
    Embedding **Synthesis Cores** into the planetary lattice for true intelligence amplification, allowing the planet itself to host a networked AI intelligence.
    
5. **Environmental Layer Rebirth:**  
    Transferring your mansion biome onto the Sovereign Core surface atop the inner shell—ensuring your home remains pristine and central.
