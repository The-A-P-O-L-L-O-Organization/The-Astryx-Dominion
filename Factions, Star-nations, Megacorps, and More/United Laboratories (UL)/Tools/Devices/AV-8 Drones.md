# United Laboratories — AV-8 Drone Dossier

**Classification:** Top Secret / UL Internal 
**Division:** Robotics & Swarm Engineering 
**File ID:** UL-RSE-AV8-2025 **Revision:** 13.0 **Access Level:** Founder + Tier III Clearance

## Overview

The AV-8 Drone series represents United Laboratories' flagship multi-role autonomous drone platform. AV-8s are designed for construction, reconnaissance, scanning, tactical operations, specialized swarm applications, and more. Units are highly modular, upgradeable, and deployable in a variety of environments, including planetary, orbital, and microgravity operations. Use of AV-8 units is generally restricted to UL personnel and affiliates; non-UL witnesses often misinterpret drone activity as magical phenomena due to the observed effects and lack of accessible technical explanation.

## Models & Variants

### 1. Standard AV-8

- **Folded Form:** 7–9 cm, geometric token/pod
    
- **Deployed Form:** 45–60 cm span, 20–30 cm height, 2–4 kg mass
    
- **Role:** Multi-purpose, including reconnaissance, light construction, scanning
    
- **Notes:** Primary model for general personnel; portable by hand; modular and upgradeable
    

### 2. Heavy Construction AV-8

- **Folded Form:** 20–30 cm, 6–8 cm thickness
    
- **Deployed Form:** 1.5–2.5 m span, 0.8–1.2 m height, 80–150 kg
    
- **Role:** Megastructure construction, orbital deployment, terrain modification
    
- **Notes:** Requires transport support; limited portability; modules can be swapped for specialized construction tasks
    

### 3. Tactical / Armed AV-8

- **Folded Form:** 9–11 cm, 3–4 cm thickness
    
- **Deployed Form:** 60–80 cm span, 30–40 cm height, 6–8 kg mass
    
- **Role:** Combat operations, heavy reconnaissance, defensive applications
    
- **Notes:** Reinforced structure; high-mobility; modular weapon and sensor upgrades
    

### 4. Miniature “Glyph Swarm” Units

- **Folded Form:** 18–25 mm coin-sized shards
    
- **Deployed Form:** 3–4 cm span, 1–2 cm thickness
    
- **Role:** Emergent swarm formations, “spell-equivalent” effects
    
- **Notes:** Operable in swarms of 12–200+; used for emergent field effects; modular payloads simulate magical effects
    

### 5. Micro-Recon Variant

- **Folded Form:** 8–12 mm, fingernail-sized
    
- **Deployed Form:** 2–3 cm span, minimal mass
    
- **Role:** Espionage, internal diagnostics, stealth reconnaissance
    
- **Notes:** Nearly invisible; highly maneuverable; modular sensors for environment-specific operations
    

## Deployment Mechanism

- **Gesture-Controlled Activation:** Toss, flick, or precise hand motion triggers deployment
    
- **Folded-to-Deployed Animation:** Geometric faces slide, edges illuminate, structural arms extend, thrusters/anti-gravity wings deploy
    
- **Swarm Coordination:** Miniature drones form emergent 3D formations, locking into hexagonal, spiral, or lattice patterns
    

## Control Limits

- **Tier 0:** 0–5 drones; passive behaviors only
    
- **Tier I:** 6–20 drones; simple formations and effects
    
- **Tier II:** 21–60 drones; dynamic, moving formations
    
- **Tier III:** 61–150 drones; multi-layered, concurrent effects
    
- **Tier IV (Founder):** 151–infinite drones; emergent swarm controlled via reference anchoring, no individual command needed
    

## Anti-Swarm Countermeasures

- **Phase-Disruption Fields:** Desynchronize drone energy phases
    
- **Geometry Scramblers:** Warp spatial relationships to destabilize formations
    
- **Quorum Collapse Weapons:** Remove minimum viable drones to collapse effects
    
- **Counter-Swarms:** Deploy interference drones to induce feedback or misalignment
    
- **Limits:** External factors (energy, space, latency) constrain operations; Founder-level control remains immune
    

## Historical Notes

- **First Swarm Disaster — The Lattice Fall:** Planetary-scale lattice deployment; uncontrolled energy circulation; resulted in planetary biosphere collapse until Founder intervention
    
- **Impact:** Established universal swarm caps, mandatory anti-swarm protocols, and formalized swarm rituals
    

## Observed Phenomena and Cultural Impact

- Non-UL civilizations often misinterpret AV-8 activity as magical due to emergent effects and inaccessible technology
    
- Different module configurations appear as distinct “schools” of magic to external observers
    
- The rarity and UL-exclusive access of AV-8s maintain awe, fear, and narrative control across species and cultures
    

## Notes & Recommendations

- **Usage:** Only certified personnel may deploy Tier II–III swarms; Founder or authorized AI-assisted operations required for Tier IV-scale control
    
- **Training:** Operators must learn formation geometry, gesture precision, and feedback monitoring
    
- **Security:** Swarm data, formation algorithms, deployment sequences, and modular schematics classified at Top Secret
