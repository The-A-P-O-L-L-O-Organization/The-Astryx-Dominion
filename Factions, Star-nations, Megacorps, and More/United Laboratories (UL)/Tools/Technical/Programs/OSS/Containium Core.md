### **Containium Core: Open-Source Galactic Containerization**

**Purpose:**  
Containium Core allows allied star-nations, corporations, research institutions, and even independent innovators to deploy containerized applications and simulations with UL-grade efficiency and security—without giving access to UL’s proprietary AI or SHADOW’s monitoring.

### **Key Features**

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
    
    - Fully compatible with standard Linux container formats.
        
    - Can run on both terrestrial and orbital servers, as well as mobile research stations.
        
    - Works on systems with modest hardware, making it accessible to emerging colonies.
        
2. **Secure Collaboration**
    
    - Containers can be shared between allied nations with cryptographic guarantees of integrity.
        
    - Optional sandboxing ensures that no container can access another’s private systems.
        
3. **Simulation Capabilities**
    
    - Supports basic to moderately advanced simulations: environmental modeling, AI prototyping, robotics simulations, and biological experimentation.
        
    - Does **not** include SHADOW-level predictive or offensive monitoring. Users must manage security themselves.
        
4. **Orchestration Tools**
    
    - Includes open-source orchestration tools inspired by UL’s internal AI-managed lifecycle—but without autonomous SHADOW integration.
        
    - Supports automated scaling, replication, and basic load balancing across connected servers.
        
5. **Educational & R&D Support**
    
    - UL encourages use of Containium Core in universities, labs, and startups to standardize collaborative experimentation.
        
    - Full documentation and sample container projects provided to teach advanced deployment strategies.
        
6. **Galaxy-Wide Accessibility**
    
    - Available via UL’s public software repositories, with regular updates and community-driven development.
        
    - UL hosts a community hub for code sharing, tutorials, and innovation challenges linked to the Innovation Summit.
