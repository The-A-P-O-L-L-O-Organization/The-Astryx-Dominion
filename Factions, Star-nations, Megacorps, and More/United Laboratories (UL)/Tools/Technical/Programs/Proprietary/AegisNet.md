### AegisNet — UL Network Guardian

**Category:** Network Security & Traffic Filtering  
**Status:** Active Deployment (UL & allied networks)

---

### **Overview**

AegisNet is UL’s advanced, AI-assisted network filtering system designed to protect planetary, orbital, and interstellar networks from malware, intrusive tracking, phishing attempts, and other digital threats. It functions as the galaxy-scale evolution of concepts like Pi-hole but is integrated with SHADOW for proactive defense.

### **Core Features**

1. **Galaxy-Scale DNS Filtering**
    
    - Filters requests at planetary, station, or fleet levels.
        
    - Blocks malicious domains, phishing attempts, and ad/tracker networks in real time.
        
    - Works seamlessly across terrestrial, orbital, and deep-space communication networks.
        
2. **SHADOW Integration**
    
    - Continuously receives threat intelligence from SHADOW.
        
    - Anticipates and neutralizes emerging threats before they affect UL networks.
        
    - Autonomous adaptive rules allow instant response to zero-day vulnerabilities.
        
3. **User Privacy & Data Protection**
    
    - Default zero-logging mode for citizens and allied networks.
        
    - Analytics are aggregated and anonymized, used only for threat prevention.
        
    - Encrypted communication between nodes to prevent eavesdropping.
        
4. **Customizable Access Policies**
    
    - Policies can be defined for sectors, fleets, colonies, or specific devices.
        
    - Can whitelist critical systems or blacklist experimental domains.
        
    - Emergency override available for UL operatives and System-controlled infrastructure.
        
5. **Distributed Architecture**
    
    - Uses a combination of planetary nodes, orbital relays, and satellite clusters.
        
    - Redundant nodes ensure zero downtime in high-traffic scenarios or partial system failure.
        
    - Local nodes cache rules for faster response and minimal latency in isolated systems.
        
6. **Open-Source Version for Allies**
    
    - Lightweight variant for UL-allied nations or corporations.
        
    - Provides secure ad/tracker filtering while maintaining compatibility with SHADOW-managed networks.
        
    - Encourages adoption and standardization of safe network practices galaxy-wide.
        
7. **Autonomous Threat Remediation**
    
    - Can isolate infected nodes or networks automatically.
        
    - Alerts human administrators and proposes corrective actions.
        
    - When paired with SHADOW, can simulate potential breaches to test defenses in real time.
