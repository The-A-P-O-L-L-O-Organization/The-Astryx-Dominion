### **Overview**

Lexora is UL’s answer to tools like Ollama, GPT, and other AI language systems. It’s a galaxy-scale suite of models for natural language understanding, multi-modal reasoning, code generation, research analysis, and operational support. Lexora powers both public-facing services and internal UL operations, including System, SHADOW, and allied interfaces.
