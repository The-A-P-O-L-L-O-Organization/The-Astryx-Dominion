### **UL’s Virtualization + Orchestration Platform**

**Name:** **Aethergrid**  
_(instead of Proxmox, this name implies a vast, interconnected lattice of computing nodes that can scale from a single rack to a whole galaxy)_

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Quantum-Virtual Layer (QVL)**
    
    - Instead of just using KVM/QEMU or LXC, Aethergrid integrates **quantum-simulated environments**. This allows UL to run VMs _ahead of time_ (predictive execution) and rollback to "probability branches" if needed.
        
    - Essentially: a VM that can test-run a future state before committing to it.
        
2. **Multi-Reality Partitioning**
    
    - Traditional Proxmox gives you LXC containers + full VMs.
        
    - Aethergrid adds **Hybrid Reality Partitions** (HRPs), which let you spin up environments that mix simulation, physical devices, and distributed clusters.
        
    - Example: you could virtualize not just servers, but also **a lab, a starship subsystem, or even a colony habitat model** — and then deploy it in real-time.
        
3. **Aethergrid UI**
    
    - Proxmox has its neat web UI — UL’s version would be **holographic VR/AR integrated**, but still accessible via text and web terminals.
        
    - You could literally walk through a datacenter, point to a node, and scale its resources.
        
4. **Self-Healing Fabric**
    
    - If a VM/container goes down, Aethergrid doesn’t just migrate it — it _rebuilds and reinforces it automatically_.
        
    - Think of it like Kubernetes, but woven into the OS kernel level — _OS-native orchestration_.
        
5. **Hyper-Federation**
    
    - Aethergrid clusters can link across planets and galaxies. Latency isn’t an issue because UL uses **Entangled State Relays (ESRs)** for communication.
        
    - A “cluster” could be half in a server room and half in another galaxy.
