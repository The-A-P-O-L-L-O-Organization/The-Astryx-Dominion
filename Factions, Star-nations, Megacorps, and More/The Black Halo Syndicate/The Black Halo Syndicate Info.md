_(Known simply as “the Halo” in underworld circles)_

They don’t conquer worlds.  
They **liquidate** them.

### Core Identity

The Black Halo Syndicate is a transstellar criminal organization that specializes in **planetary collapse economics**.

Where empires wage wars for territory, the Halo wages wars for _aftermath_.

Their business model is simple:

- Engineer the destruction of a world
    
- Control evacuation corridors
    
- Acquire survivors as labor, soldiers, specialists, or leverage
    
- Strip-mine the remains—socially, economically, and physically
    

To the galaxy at large, they are smugglers, merc brokers, and fixers.  
To the people who’ve seen their symbol over a burning sky, they are the end.

## Symbol & Reputation

**Symbol:** A broken ring encircling a dim star  
**Calling Card:** Black triangular beacons left in orbit after a “job”  
**Reputation:**

- Feared, but not openly hunted
    
- Considered a “necessary evil” by some regimes
    
- Whispered about by refugees who stop mid-sentence when asked who did it
    

The Halo does not announce itself.  
If people know they were there, something went wrong.

## Organizational Structure

The Halo is not a loose gang. It is **corporate-criminal**, coldly layered.

### 1. The Inner Ring

The true leadership. Unknown names. Unknown species.

- Never appear in person
    
- Communicate through masked intermediaries or voice-scrubbed proxies
    
- Make decisions in terms of _yield_, not morality
    

Even high-ranking members don’t know who sits on the Inner Ring.

### 2. Architects

Strategists who design planetary collapse.

They don’t pull triggers. They:

- Destabilize economies
    
- Bribe orbital defense officials
    
- Introduce “accidental” reactor failures
    
- Seed political fractures that become wars
    

If a planet dies “naturally,” an Architect probably nudged it.

### 3. Reapers

The visible horror.

- Arrive during the final days or hours
    
- Control evacuation points, refugee fleets, and safe corridors
    
- Decide who lives, who is abandoned, and who is “recruited”
    

Reapers are the ones survivors remember.

### 4. The Taken

Survivors pressed into Halo service.

Not slaves—_assets with debts_.

Roles include:

- Mercenaries
    
- Enforcers
    
- Ship crews
    
- Informants
    
- Specialists who can never afford to leave
    

Your player’s character almost certainly came from here.

## The Destroyed Planet (Kris's PC Backstory Tie)

From the Halo’s perspective, the planet wasn’t “destroyed.”

It was **written off**.

Possible reasons:

- Strategic location competing with Halo trade lanes
    
- Valuable population (strong fighters, engineers, pilots)
    
- Political refusal to cooperate with Halo interests
    
- Sold out by a neighboring power who wanted plausible deniability
    

The Halo engineered the collapse, then:

- Arrived with evacuation fleets
    
- Offered “salvation” contracts
    
- Took survivors who agreed
    
- Left the rest to die
    

The player survived because:

- He signed on
    
- He was taken forcibly
    
- Or someone else signed for him
    

That ambiguity is powerful. You don’t even need to decide yet.

## Culture & Philosophy

The Halo believes one thing:

> “Survival creates obligation.”

If you live because of them, you _owe_ them.

They don’t see themselves as villains. In their view:

- The galaxy is brutal anyway
    
- Someone else would have destroyed the planet
    
- They just monetized the inevitable
    

That moral rot makes them terrifyingly reasonable in conversation.

## Relationship to the Kris's PC

The mob didn’t just hire him.

They **own his origin**.

Possible hooks:

- A former Reaper recognizes him by name
    
- A debt record still exists under his genetic signature
    
- Another survivor blames him for working with the Halo
    
- The Halo considers him “inactive property,” not free
    

Even if he escaped, the Halo remembers.

They always do.

---

## Why They Took Survivors Instead of Killing Them

Because survivors are valuable.

- Fighters forged by loss
    
- Workers with no home to return to
    
- People who will do anything to avoid another extinction
    

The Halo doesn’t recruit loyalty.  
They recruit **fear with nowhere else to go**.

---

## How They Appear in a Campaign

They don’t attack openly.

They:

- Offer contracts that feel wrong but pay too well
    
- Control black-market access the party suddenly needs
    
- Show up after disasters the party thought were accidents
    
- Know things they shouldn’t—about the PCs, their pasts, their planets
    

And eventually, one NPC says something like:

> “Funny thing about your world.  
> We still have the evacuation manifests.”

That’s when the table goes quiet.

## Tone Guidance

The Black Halo Syndicate works best when:

- They are calm, professional, and polite
    
- They never justify themselves loudly
    
- They treat genocide like accounting
    

No monologues.  
No mustache-twirling.

Just people who look at a ruined planet and say:  
“Alright. What’s the salvage value?”
