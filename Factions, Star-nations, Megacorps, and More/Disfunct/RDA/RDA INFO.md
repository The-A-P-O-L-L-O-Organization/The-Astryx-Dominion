## RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION (RDA) — INTERNAL DB ENTRY

**Faction Designation:** RDA / Ex-RDA  
**Full Title:** Resource Development Administration  
**Jurisdiction:** Alpha Centauri System (formerly)  
**Status:** Dissolved — Assets and oversight absorbed by United Laboratories (UL)  
**Date of Dissolution:** 2191-07-14 (GC Emergency Session)  
**Archive Classification:** GC Public Record / UL Internal Custodial Archive

### 1. Overview

The **Resource Development Administration (RDA)** was a corporate megacorporation tasked with:

- Planetary resource extraction
    
- Environmental management
    
- Logistical and infrastructural oversight
    

Operational misconduct revealed through **GC investigation** included:

- Systematic ecological destruction
    
- Crimes against sentient populations (Article VII, GC)
    
- Obstruction of justice and evidence tampering
    

Following a **GC Extraordinary Tribunal**, RDA was dissolved, and **all assets, infrastructure, and operational authority were transferred to UL** for planetary remediation and custodial oversight.

---

### 2. Historical Context

- RDA operated autonomously across multiple planetary nodes within Alpha Centauri.
    
- Internal audits revealed **self-destructive fail-safes** triggered by external audits or intrusions.
    
- Directives included forced relocation of populations and environmental clearance of native habitats via automated extraction units.

### 3. Legal Proceedings & Dissolution

**GC Emergency Tribunal — 2191-07-14**

- **Charges:** Crimes against sentient life, environmental destruction, obstruction of justice
    
- **Evidence:**
    
    - Operational logs authorizing population clearance
        
    - Eyewitness survivor testimonies
        
    - Drone footage of extraction operations and scorched biosites
        
    - Internal command scripts designed for obfuscation and telemetry blackout
        
- **Defense Claims:** Challenged UL cyber-retrieval legitimacy and asserted corporate sovereign operations
    
- **Tribunal Finding:** Leadership culpable; dissolution ordered
    
- **Asset Transfer:** Planetary stewardship, system remediation, and forensic access assigned to UL (custodial mandate)
    

---

### 4. Operational Fallout

- Critical RDA infrastructure suffered cascading failures during UL data-retrieval due to embedded self-protective scripts.
    
- Humanitarian impact: disrupted life-support and environmental control networks; UL deployed immediate triage and stabilization.
    
- Planetary stewardship: UL assumed responsibility for ecological restoration, survivor protection, and long-term system stability under GC oversight.

### 5. UL Integration

- **Assets Absorbed:** Physical infrastructure, archival data, automated systems, and command archives
    
- **Forensic Security:** Packages secured in the **Genesis Vault** to ensure non-repudiable archival of evidence
    
- **Operational Policy:** UL mandated custodial use only; **commercial exploitation prohibited**
    
- **Cultural Consideration:** Ongoing consultation with native populations (e.g., Na’vi delegations) required for ethically-sensitive restoration
    

---

### 6. Legacy & Notes

- Serves as a case study in **corporate overreach and ethical failure in planetary resource management**
    
- Established precedent for **emergency GC tribunals to reassign corporate oversight** for planetary protection
    
- Reinforced UL’s operational protocols for responsible resource stewardship and ethical compliance in former RDA systems
    
- GC Tribunal maintains parallel inquiry into authorization procedures, UL compliance, and Council procedural integrity

### 7. Field Report Excerpt

**UL Field Dispatch (Ambassador Vek Soran):**

> “UL has taken control of all primary planetary nodes. Stabilization teams are rerouting emergency life-support, triage branches are operational, and ecological remediation begins at first light. All operations proceed under GC oversight and with consultation of native populations.”

**Archive Note:** RDA internal command archives remain **sealed**, access restricted to UL forensic analysts and GC Tribunal review teams.
