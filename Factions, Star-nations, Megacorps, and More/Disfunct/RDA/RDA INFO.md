# **RDA — Resource Development Administration**

**Designation:** Ex-RDA / Corporate Dissolved Entity  
**Full Title:** Resource Development Administration  
**Jurisdiction:** Alpha Centauri System (formerly)  
**Status:** Dissolved — Assets and oversight absorbed into United Laboratories (UL)  
**Date of Dissolution:** 2191-07-14 (GC Emergency Session)  
**Archive Classification:** GC Public Record / UL Internal Custodial Archive

---

## **I. Overview**

The Resource Development Administration (RDA) was a corporate entity charged with planetary resource extraction, environmental management, and logistical oversight within Alpha Centauri. Investigations by the Galactic Community revealed extensive violations of planetary and ethical law, including:

- Systematic ecological destruction
    
- Crimes against sentient populations (Article VII GC)
    
- Obstruction of justice and deliberate evidence tampering
    

Following a **GC Extraordinary Tribunal**, RDA was dissolved and all assets, infrastructure, and operational authority were **temporarily transferred to United Laboratories (UL)** for planetary remediation and oversight.

---

## **II. Historical Context**

- RDA operated autonomously across multiple planetary nodes.
    
- Internal audits and field reports indicated **self-destructive fail-safes** within command architecture, triggered when external audits or intrusions were detected.
    
- Previous RDA directives included forced relocation and environmental clearance of native populations, executed via autonomous extraction units.

## **III. Legal Proceedings & Dissolution**

**Emergency Session Summary — GC Tribunal 2191-07-14:**

- **Charges:** Crimes against sentient life, environmental destruction, obstruction of justice
    
- **Evidence:**
    
    - Operational logs authorizing population clearance
        
    - Eyewitness survivor depositions
        
    - Drone footage of extraction units and scorched biosites
        
    - Internal command scripts for obfuscation and telemetry blackout
        
- **Defense Claims:** Challenge to legality of UL cyber-retrieval and sovereign corporate operations
    
- **Tribunal Finding:** RDA leadership culpable; dissolution ordered
    
- **Asset Transfer:** Planetary stewardship, system remediation, and forensic access assigned to UL (custodial mandate)
    

---

## **IV. Operational Fallout**

- RDA’s critical infrastructure suffered cascading failures during UL data-retrieval operations due to embedded self-protective scripts.
    
- Humanitarian consequences: disrupted life-support and environmental control networks; UL immediately deployed triage and stabilization protocols.
    
- Planetary stewardship: UL tasked with remediation, ecological restoration, and survivor protection under GC oversight.
    

---

## **V. UL Integration**

- All RDA assets, including physical infrastructure, archival data, and automated systems, were **absorbed by UL**.
    
- Forensic packages were secured in the **Genesis Vault**, ensuring non-repudiable archival of evidence.
    
- UL mandated custodial use only: **no commercial exploitation of planetary resources permitted**.
    
- Ongoing consultation with native populations (Na’vi delegations) required for culturally-sensitive restoration.
    

---

## **VI. Legacy & Notes**

- RDA is a case study in **corporate overreach and ethical failure in planetary resource management**.
    
- Dissolution precedent: Emergency Tribunal powers can reassign corporate oversight to capable entities for planetary protection.
    
- UL’s role as custodian established operational protocols for responsible resource stewardship and ethical compliance in former RDA systems.
    
- GC Tribunal continues parallel inquiry into authorization procedures, UL compliance, and Council procedural integrity.

**Quote from UL Field Dispatch (Ambassador Vek Soran):**

> “UL has taken control of all primary planetary nodes. Stabilization teams are rerouting emergency life-support, triage branches are operational, and ecological remediation begins at first light. All operations proceed under GC oversight and with consultation of native populations.”

**Archive Note:** RDA internal command archives remain **sealed**; access restricted to UL forensic analysts and GC Tribunal review teams.
