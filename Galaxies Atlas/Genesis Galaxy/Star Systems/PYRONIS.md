## **I. Primary Star — PYRONIS**

- **Type:** M2V Red Dwarf (Main Sequence)
    
- **Mass:** 0.42 Solar Masses
    
- **Radius:** 0.52 Solar Radii
    
- **Luminosity:** 0.03 Solar Luminosities
    
- **Surface Temperature:** ~3,450 K
    
- **Age:** ~3.9 Billion Years
    
- **Rotation Period:** 38.1 Earth Days
    

**Notes:**

- Pyronis exhibits regular stellar flares, which are harnessed for industrial energy.
    
- Monitored by MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS subfunctions for orbital safety and energy output.

## **II. Inner Planet — PYRONIS–VULCAN**

**UL Planetary Entry:** #PV-01  
**Classification:** Molten Terrestrial Planet  
**Orbital Distance:** 0.39 AU  
**Primary Function:** Industrial Fabrication World  
**AI Oversight:** HEPHAESTUS (Primary)

### **Planetary Profile**

- **Diameter:** 13,200 km
    
- **Gravity:** 1.04 g
    
- **Rotation Period:** 28.6 hours
    
- **Surface Temperature:** 1,300–2,800°C
    
- **Atmosphere:** Sulfur dioxide–dominant, neon and argon rich
    

**Notes:**

- Vulcan’s surface is molten; only machine-based operations exist.
    
- Surface and atmospheric activity are continuously monitored.
    
- Alloy production and energy harvesting occur under standard HEPHAESTUS protocols.

## **III. System Function & Observations**

- Pyronis and Vulcan are integrated into UL’s industrial network for **energy extraction and alloy processing**.
    
- Planetary flares and magnetic phenomena are recorded for system stability and resource management.
    
- Observations focus on safe operation, resource throughput, and orbital integrity.

## **IV. Strategic Summary**

- **Purpose:** High-yield industrial forge, energy conversion, and alloy production.
    
- **Operational Scope:** Fully automated with monitored AI control; no biological life present.
    
- **Employee Access Level:** Gamma — observation, monitoring, and basic reporting only.
    
- **Risk Assessment:** High-temperature, high-magnetic-field environment; hazards are limited to machine containment and energy anomalies.
