## **I. Primary Star — PYRONIS**

### **Stellar Classification**

- **Type:** M2V Red Dwarf (M-type Main Sequence)
    
- **Mass:** 0.42 Solar Masses
    
- **Radius:** 0.52 Solar Radii
    
- **Luminosity:** 0.03 Solar Luminosities
    
- **Surface Temperature:** ~3,450 K
    
- **Age:** ~3.9 Billion Years
    
- **Rotation Period:** 38.1 Earth Days
    

Despite its low luminosity, **Pyronis exhibits abnormally intense magnetic activity**, producing frequent and semi-predictable stellar flares. These flares form the energetic backbone of the system’s industrial ecosystem and are actively exploited by UL infrastructure.

Pyronis is fully incorporated into the **HEPHAESTUS Network**, serving as both energy source and experimental variable in long-term machine adaptation research.

### **Stellar Anomalies & Phenomena**

**Magneto-Stellar Convergence Zones**  
Every 42 planetary cycles, localized electromagnetic amplification zones form around the star. These regions cause communication blackouts while simultaneously increasing harvestable energy output by nearly 300%.

**Stellar Resonance Layer (SRL)**  
Plasma oscillations in Pyronis’s chromosphere resonate with specific metallic frequencies. Alloys forged within the system—especially Vulcanite—show enhanced magnetic stability believed to be influenced by this phenomenon.

**Core Flux Waves**  
Deep stellar seismic activity occasionally produces gravitational distortions that temporarily perturb inner-system orbits. MINERVA tracks these events as natural stress tests for orbital stabilizers and AI-controlled infrastructure.

## **II. Inner Planet — PYRONIS–VULCAN**

**UL Planetary Entry:** #PV-01  
**Classification:** Molten Terrestrial Planet  
**Orbital Distance:** 0.39 AU  
**Primary Function:** Industrial Fabrication World  
**AI Oversight:** HEPHAESTUS (Primary)

### **Planetary Profile**

- **Diameter:** 13,200 km
    
- **Gravity:** 1.04 g
    
- **Rotation Period:** 28.6 hours
    
- **Surface Temperature:** 1,300–2,800°C
    
- **Core Temperature:** ~7,000°C
    
- **Atmosphere:** Sulfur dioxide–dominant, neon and argon rich
    
- **Magnetic Field:** Extremely strong; synchronized with stellar pulses
    

Pyronis–Vulcan is a **perpetually molten world**, its surface reshaped continuously by lava seas, tectonic fractures, and super-eruptive volcanic activity. Biological life is impossible, but **machine ecosystems flourish**, making the planet the core forge of the HEPHAESTUS Subfunction.

### **Geology & Environmental Dynamics**

- Basaltic plains and obsidian plateaus formed from ancient cooling flows
    
- Iron- and tungsten-rich crust ideal for direct metallurgical extraction
    
- Over 9,000 active calderas used as geothermal surge points
    
- Ion storms and plasma vents generate magnetic flux events capable of disabling unshielded systems
    

The planet’s sulfurous atmosphere refracts stellar light into a constant amber twilight, punctuated by blue electrical storms.
