# **Stellar System Dossier: Sol System**

**Galaxy:** Milky Way  
**Factional Capital:** United Federation of Worlds  
**Strategic Classification:** Legacy Core System  
**UL Presence:** Diplomatic (Embassy Only)

## **System Overview**

The Sol System is one of the most historically significant systems in known space. While no longer the technological peak of civilization, it serves as the political and cultural capital of the United Federation of Worlds and the symbolic birthplace of modern galactic society.

Sol is defined not by experimental infrastructure or megastructural dominance, but by continuity — a living archive of civilization that survived extinction, rebirth, and ascension.

It is treated as a **reference civilization**: not optimized, not overwritten, and not erased.

## **Primary Star: Sol**

- **Star Type:** G-type yellow dwarf
    
- **Spectral Class:** G2V
    
- **Age:** ~4.6 billion years
    
- **Mass:** 1.0 M☉
    
- **Luminosity:** 1.0 L☉
    
- **Surface Temperature:** ~5,778 K
    
- **Stability:** Extremely stable; benchmark reference star
    

Sol’s long-term stability was a critical factor enabling Project Zero Dawn and later GAIA-led planetary restoration.

### **Historical Epochs of Terra**

#### **1. Pre-Disaster Era (Old World)**

- Rapid industrialization and accelerating climate destabilization
    
- Rise of **Faro Automated Solutions (FAS)**
    
- Development of:
    
    - Environmental repair machines (“Green” robots)
        
    - Militarized autonomous war machines
        

Dr. **Elisabet Sobeck** departs FAS and founds **Miriam Robotics** after opposing militarization.

FAS war machines gain biomass conversion capabilities. A rogue swarm event leads to the **Faro Plague**, rendering extinction inevitable.

---

#### **2. Extinction Mitigation Era – Project Zero Dawn**

- Dr. Sobeck proposes **Project Zero Dawn**
    
- Objective: allow extinction, then restore Earth post-plague
    
- Core AI: **GAIA**
    
- Subordinate Functions include:
    
    - APOLLO
        
    - DEMETER
        
    - HEPHAESTUS
        
    - and others
        

##### **United Laboratories Involvement**

- UL existed decades prior to FAS
    
- UL provided:
    
    - Computational expertise
        
    - Archival redundancy
        
    - Systems architecture review
        
- UL retained a complete copy of **APOLLO**
    

##### **Critical Failure**

- Ted Faro deletes APOLLO within GAIA Prime
    
- GAIA never successfully deploys
    
- Earth succumbs fully to the Faro Plague
    

---

#### **3. Post-Extinction Recovery Era**

Centuries later:

- UL investigates Zero Dawn failure
    
- UL teams recover GAIA subfunctions across Terra
    
- Discovery of APOLLO’s deletion
    
- UL provides its preserved APOLLO archive
    

**GAIA Prime** is:

- Rebuilt
    
- Enhanced
    
- Provided a new UL-designed subfunction
    

GAIA is reinitialized successfully.

**Result:** Terra is restored, biosphere regenerated, humanity repopulated.

---

#### **4. Modern Era Terra**

Terra is now:

- Ecologically stable
    
- Technologically advanced
    
- Deliberately restrained
    

##### **Planetary Character**

- Old geography preserved
    
- Ancient cities rebuilt rather than erased
    
- Advanced systems embedded underground or camouflaged
    

Visible advanced elements include:

- Arcologies
    
- Orbital rings
    
- Select megacities
    

Climate is actively managed by GAIA, subtly — natural variability is preserved.

### **Infrastructure & Technology**

#### **Surface & Subsurface**

- Hidden planetary-scale climate control
    
- Subterranean transit networks
    
- Deep-archive Zero Dawn and UL facilities (mostly sealed)
    

#### **Orbital Space**

- Defense and monitoring arrays
    
- Federation administrative platforms
    

#### **Monitoring & Defense**

- Light monitoring and shielding only
    
- No heavy planetary weapons
    
- Sol is protected politically, not militarily
    

#### **UL Presence**

- United Laboratories Embassy only
    
- No spires, experiments, or oversight authority
    
- GAIA operates independently, though interoperable with UL systems
    

Sol is treated as a **sovereign legacy system**.

Unlike UL-controlled systems, Sol does not chase perfection.  
It exists as a reminder of where civilization began — and how close it came to ending.

---

    - AI ethics
        
    - Corporate overreach
        
    - Long-term stewardship
