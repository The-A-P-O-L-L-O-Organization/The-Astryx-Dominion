## **Quest 1: Operation Recall**

**Briefing from the Founder via Theseus:**

> “A small, unregulated company—**Quen Dynamics**—was found breaking galactic law. Their assets have been seized and absorbed into United Laboratories. However, several of their higher-ranking members escaped capture. Warrants for their arrest have been issued. Your mission: locate these individuals, apprehend them, and return them alive. Dead targets do not further UL’s mission.”

### **Why this works as a first quest**

- **Clear objective**: Capture, don’t kill.
    
- **Flexibility**: The targets could be hiding on a station, out in the wild, or even trying to escape the system.
    
- **Introduces choices**:
    
    - Do the players go in guns blazing and risk breaking UL standards?
        
    - Do they negotiate or trick their targets into surrendering?
        
    - What if one of the higher-ups claims UL framed them, or has valuable intel?

## **Fugitive Profile – Draven Veylor**

- **Role in Company:** Former CFO of the outlawed startup.
    
- **Crime:** Large-scale embezzlement and _illegal AI research_ (classified as “dangerous to public safety” under galactic law).
    
- **Personality:** Smug, self-assured, convinced his money can buy him safety. Rarely fights directly; hides behind contracts, lawyers, and mercenaries.
    
- **Weakness:** Overconfidence in his ability to outsmart systems. Signed the “Bounty Protection” agreement without reading the fine print.

## **The Bounty Protection Company (BPC)**

- **Name:** _Ironshield Bounty Retainers, LLC_
    
- **Motto:** “Pay your price, sleep at night.”
    
- **Business Model:** If you have a bounty, you pay Ironshield the amount of your bounty (plus fees), and they’ll defend you against bounty hunters.
    
- **Contract Clause:** Hidden deep in the fine print — if law enforcement or legal warrants are presented, Ironshield must cooperate and hand over the client.
    
- **Reputation:** Neutral, very by-the-book. They don’t break contracts, ever, because their reputation is everything.

## **Encounter Setup**

1. **The Approach:**
    
    - The players arrive at Ironshield HQ on the frontier world of _Drelvus Station_. It’s a fortified bunker-office with mercenary guards.
        
    - They’re told Draven is under Ironshield protection and cannot be touched.
        
2. **The Legal Maneuver:**
    
    - If the players present System’s authenticated GC warrant (which is GC-standard and airtight), Ironshield’s AI will instantly scan the documents.
        
    - Once verified, Ironshield apologizes, refunds Draven’s “coverage fee,” and hands him over, bound.
        
3. **Draven’s Reaction:**
    
    - Absolutely _furious._ He tries to argue, plead, or even bribe the players to “look the other way.”
        
    - Could offer them a deal: “Help me escape, and I’ll give you access to my hidden offshore accounts. UL doesn’t have to know.”

## **Possible Twists**

- **Paperwork Obstacle:** Maybe the GC warrant is encoded and needs to be formally “activated” with System’s legal clearance before Ironshield accepts it. Gives players a puzzle/social step.
    
- **BPC’s Neutrality Tested:** Rival bounty hunters might attack the station while the players are there, forcing the PCs and Ironshield to fight side-by-side before the handover.
    
- **Draven’s Secret Asset:** He smuggled something dangerous into Ironshield’s custody (prototype AI shard, illicit tech). If discovered, UL will _definitely_ want it.

# **Fugitive 2 – Captain Seraya Korr**

- **Theme:** Frontier Wilderness Survival
    
- **Background:** Former COO of the outlawed company. When the warrants came out, she fled into the frontier and vanished into the badlands. Known survivalist, ex-military scout, and ruthless opportunist.
    
- **Location:** Hiding in the **Ashwaste Expanse** — a vast canyon-riddled desert planet where only scavengers and smugglers roam.
    
- **Complication:** Locals know her as “The Widow in the Canyons” — she pays them with supplies and protection. Some genuinely admire her. Turning her in feels like betraying the community.
    
- **Capture Method:**
    
    - **Survival Chase:** Players track her across shifting sands, through dangerous wildlife, and into collapsing caves.
        
    - **Diplomatic Angle:** If they gain the trust of locals, they might learn about her _hidden safehouse_ and even convince them to help turn her in.
        
    - **Combat Option:** She’s not defenseless — she has a stolen **stealth skimmer** and can turn the desert into a battlefield of ambushes.
        
- **Player Test:** Survival skills, moral choice, diplomacy vs. force.

# **Fugitive 3 – Dr. Halrix Quen**

- **Theme:** Corporate / Jurisdictional Politics
    
- **Background:** Chief Scientist of the outlawed company. Specialized in **neural augmentation and genetic imprinting**, projects the GC has explicitly banned after past disasters. His research could destabilize whole populations.
    
- **Location:** **Veythos Arcology** (frontier megacity). Nexora Dynamics has taken him in, calling him a “senior consultant.” They _know_ about the GC warrant but argue it has **no binding enforcement power** on Veythos without GC marshals present.
    
- **Complication:**
    
    - Nexora frames UL as “mercenaries” and claims the GC is outsourcing justice — undermining their legitimacy.
        
    - Locals see UL agents as outsiders imposing foreign law. The population may riot if the arrest feels too heavy-handed.
        
    - Dr. Quen is working on a **major breakthrough** for Nexora that could sway the frontier economy, so the corp _needs_ him.
        
- **Capture Method:**
    
    - **Diplomatic:** Convince or pressure Nexora into complying, perhaps with proof of Quen’s crimes or promises of GC trade privileges.
        
    - **Espionage:** Forge GC “direct intervention” documents, forcing Nexora to hand him over.
        
    - **Extraction:** Infiltrate his suite, bypass corp security, and grab him — risking Nexora painting UL as lawless abductors.
        
- **Player Test:** Balancing diplomacy, subterfuge, and combat. Choosing between a **clean political victory** or a **messy extraction** that could damage UL’s reputation with the GC.
