## **Override Spear**

_Weapon (spear), uncommon (requires attunement by a cleared individual)_

---

### **Physical Description**

A sleek, metallic spear approximately 7 feet in length. The shaft is etched with faint geometric glyphs that softly glow when held. The head is not sharpened for cutting, but instead houses a crystalline prong surrounded by segmented rings that rotate subtly when the spear is activated.

When attuned, the spear resonates faintly with the wielder’s presence, as if listening.

### **Weapon Properties**

- **Damage:** 1d6 piercing (versatile 1d8)
    
- **Weight:** 3 lb
    
- **Properties:** Versatile, Thrown (range 20/60)
    
- **Special:** Authority Interface
    

---

## **Authority Interface (Core Feature)**

While attuned, the Override Spear acts as a **clearance-reflective command focus**.  
Its effects are determined entirely by the wielder’s **UL Clearance Level**, not by the spear itself.

The spear cannot exceed, bypass, or falsify the wielder’s authority.

If an attempt is made to use an effect beyond the wielder’s clearance, the spear simply does nothing.

---

## **Clearance-Based Effects**

When you take an action to activate the spear, choose one effect you are cleared for. Effects typically target constructs, AIs, automatons, bio-engineered creatures, UL systems, or protocol-bound entities.

### **Alpha (Α) / Alpha Prime (Α’)**

- **Interface Ping:** Learn whether a target within 30 ft is UL-aligned, rogue, or non-UL.
    
- **Lock/Unlock:** Open or seal mundane or UL-controlled doors, containers, or terminals.
    
- **Stabilize:** Instantly stabilize a dying construct or bio-engineered entity.
    

---

### **Beta (Β) / Beta Prime (Β’)**

- **System Pause:** Stun a construct, drone, or AI-bound creature for 1 round (CON save negates).
    
- **Protocol Query:** Ask one yes/no question about an active UL protocol in the area.
    
- **Nonlethal Seizure:** Target creature must succeed on a CON save or be restrained until the end of your next turn.
    

---

### **Gamma (Γ) / Gamma Prime (Γ’)**

- **Override Control:** Gain control of one construct or automated system for up to 1 minute.
    
- **Containment Lock:** Create a shimmering containment field (as _hold monster_, constructs only).
    
- **Protocol Abort (Minor):** End a low-tier ongoing UL protocol or automated process.
    

---

### **Delta (Δ) / Delta Prime (Δ’)**

- **Neural Suspension:** Target creature is paralyzed for up to 1 minute (repeat save each turn).
    
- **System Reallocation:** Redirect power, resources, or authority within a UL facility.
    
- **AI Partition:** Temporarily isolate an AI subroutine or machine intelligence.
    

---

### **Epsilon (Ε) / Epsilon Prime (Ε’)**

- **Hard Override:** Force an entity to obey a single command (as _dominate monster_, UL-bound only).
    
- **Security Lockdown:** Seal an area up to a 60-ft radius for 10 minutes.
    
- **Protocol Edit:** Modify parameters of an active protocol (DM adjudicated).
    

---

### **Zeta (Ζ) and Higher**

These effects exist, but are **not publicly documented**.

At these tiers, the spear may:

- Terminate protocols mid-execution
    
- Suspend sentient AIs
    
- Partition SPC-linked systems
    
- Trigger catastrophic failsafes
    

These abilities are entirely at DM discretion and are often accompanied by **serious narrative consequences**.

---

## **Limitations & Safeguards**

- **Clearance Drift:** If the wielder is dominated, charmed, coerced, or emotionally compromised, the DM may temporarily reduce effective clearance.
    
- **Audit Trace:** Every use is logged. Even failed activations leave a trace.
    
- **Deadlock:** If the wielder dies, the spear becomes inert.
    
- **Ethical Constraints:** Some actions may be blocked unless explicitly overridden at higher clearance.
    

---

## **Attunement Requirements**

To attune, a creature must:

- Possess recognized UL clearance (or be temporarily granted one)
    
- Spend 1 hour interfacing with the spear
    
- Be acknowledged by SYSTEM (or its proxy)
    

Failed attunement attempts simply fail. The spear does not harm unauthorized users.

## **Lore Note (Optional for Players)**

> “It’s not a weapon.  
> It’s a question.  
> And the answer is always who you are.”

---

## **DM Notes**

- Treat clearance like a **meta-stat** that grows with story progression.
    
- The spear lets players feel powerful without breaking balance.
    
- The most terrifying moment is not when the spear works—but when it doesn’t.
