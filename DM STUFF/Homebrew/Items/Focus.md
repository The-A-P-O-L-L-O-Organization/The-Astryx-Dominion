## **Focus (Project: Second Sight)**

_Wondrous Item (wearable, technological), Uncommon_  
_Requires attunement_

A sleek, coin-sized augmented reality device worn at the temple or behind the ear. When active, faint holographic glyphs flicker in the wearer’s vision.

---

## **Attunement**

- The Focus **must be attuned** to operate.
    
- Once attuned, the user **cannot voluntarily unattune**.
    
- Removing or forcibly disabling the Focus triggers **Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome**.

> Narrative Note (DM): This represents the deep neural link between operator and UL systems. It encourages players to think twice before losing, destroying, or discarding the Focus. It also creates stakes if an enemy separates the operator from their AV-8 or disables UL tech.

---

## **Baseline Functions**

While attuned to the Focus, you gain the following benefits:

### **Augmented Awareness**

- Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
    
- Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to analyze **technology, machinery, or artificial creatures**.
    

> These benefits represent contextual overlays and UL knowledge databases, not active scanning.

---

### **Tactical Scan (Requires AV-8 Drone | 3 charges)**

The Focus itself cannot perform scans.

- As a **bonus action**, you may initiate a scan **through a linked AV-8 drone** within operational range.
    
- The AV-8 must have **line of effect** to the target or area being scanned.
    
- Choose a creature, object, or location within **the AV-8’s sensor range**.
    

You learn **one** of the following (your choice):

- Damage vulnerabilities or resistances
    
- Whether the target is **mechanical, biological, or hybrid**
    
- One notable **environmental, structural, or tactical weakness** detected by the AV-8
    

The Focus regains **1d3 charges daily at dawn**.

**Failure Condition:**  
If no AV-8 drone is linked, Tactical Scan **cannot be used**, regardless of remaining charges.

---

### **Encrypted Uplink**

- You can interface with **UL systems, terminals, and drones** you are authorized to access.
    
- The Focus automatically records encounters, sensor feeds, and tactical annotations.
    
- UL maintains the right to audit stored data unless countermeasures are installed.

## **Modular Upgrade System**

The Focus has **2 upgrade slots** at **Beta Prime clearance**.  
Installing or swapping an upgrade requires a **short rest**, appropriate tools, and valid authorization.

---

## **Focus Upgrades**

- **AV-8 Remote Projection Module**
    
- **Enhanced Threat Analysis Suite**
    
- **Environmental Hazard Overlay**
    
- **Stealth Suppression Filter**
    
- **Cognitive Assist Core**
    

---

## **Upgrade Scaling (Future-Proofing)**

As UL clearance increases:

- Additional upgrade slots unlock
    
- Tactical Scan options expand (multi-target, shared feeds, predictive modeling)
    
- Sensor data can be **shared between party members**
    
- Increased surveillance, tighter UL oversight, and reduced deniability
    

---

## **Design Philosophy (DM Reference)**

The Focus is not a tricorder.  
It is a **terminal**.

- The **AV-8 sees**
    
- The **Focus understands**
    
- The **operator decides**
    

Removing the drone or the Focus creates mechanical, narrative, and psychological stakes.
