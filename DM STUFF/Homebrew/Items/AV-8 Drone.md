## **AV-8 Drone (UL-Issue)**

_Wondrous Item (technological), Uncommon_  
_Requires Attunement (UL Clearance: Beta or higher)_

**Description**  
The AV-8 is a compact, hovering reconnaissance and support drone deployed by United Laboratories. It features a central optical core, multi-spectrum sensors, and four vectored grav-rotors. It hums quietly—like a patient mechanical insect waiting for instructions.

### **Functions**

**Remote Operated**  
As a **bonus action**, the attuned user may issue simple commands to the AV-8 (move, observe, follow, return).

**Multi-Spectrum Optics**  
The AV-8 provides:

- Darkvision out to 120 ft
    
- Advantage on Perception checks relying on sight
    
- Can see invisible creatures within 30 ft as faint distortions (no details)
    

**Shared Vision (Focus Compatible)**  
If the user is wearing a **UL Focus**, they may view the AV-8’s camera feed in real time. This does not require an action once enabled. Focus must have the AV-8 Remote Projection Module upgrade installed

**Tactical Ping (1/Short Rest)**  
As an action, the AV-8 scans a 30-ft radius. Hostile creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency + INT/WIS modifier) or be **outlined** until the end of the user’s next turn. Attacks against outlined targets have advantage.

---

### **Limitations**

- The AV-8 cannot attack unless upgraded.
    
- If reduced to 0 HP, it shuts down but does not explode.
    
- Repairing it requires a short rest and tinkering tools (or equivalent tech).

## **AV-8 Upgrade Modules**

These upgrades are modular; installing or swapping one requires a short rest and appropriate tools or a UL tech station.

---

### **UL-AV8-VISLINK Module** _(Standard Issue)_

_Prerequisite: UL Focus_

The AV-8’s visual feed can be **projected directly into the user’s Focus**, including:

- Picture-in-picture view
    
- Freeze-frame capture
    
- Manual zoom (up to 4×)
    

Additionally, once per turn, the user may switch their vision to the drone’s perspective **without using an action**.

---

### **UL-AV8-STEALTH Plating**

_Uncommon Upgrade_

- The AV-8 gains advantage on Stealth checks
    
- While motionless, it is considered lightly obscured
    
- Its hum becomes nearly inaudible beyond 10 ft
    

---

### **UL-AV8-DEFENSE Subroutine**

_Uncommon Upgrade_

- Increases AC to **15**
    
- Once per long rest, when the AV-8 would be hit, it can impose disadvantage on the attack roll as reactive maneuvering kicks in.
    

---

### **UL-AV8-TACTICAL Payload Mount**

_Rare Upgrade_

Allows the AV-8 to carry **one payload**, such as:

- Flash emitter (30-ft radius, CON save or blinded until next turn)
    
- EMP pulse (constructs make CON save or be stunned for 1 round)
    
- Micro-medkit (administers a healing stim remotely)
    

Payloads are consumable and UL-regulated.

---

### **UL-AV8-AUTONOMOUS AI Core**

_Rare Upgrade — Clearance: Beta Prime_

The AV-8 can act independently.

- Gains its own initiative
    
- Can take the **Help** action each round without commands
    
- May execute one pre-programmed behavior (patrol, follow, guard)

## **Narrative Notes (DM-Side Flavor)**

- UL logs every AV-8 action unless tampering is detected.
    
- Higher-clearance operatives may unlock “black modules” that are officially nonexistent.
    
- NPCs often react differently when they notice an AV-8—fear, respect, or suspicion.
