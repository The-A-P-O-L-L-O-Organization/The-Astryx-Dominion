title: Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome (SWS)
category: dm-stuff
clearance: omega_prime
tags: [neurological, UL-medical, Focus, withdrawal, cognitive, DM]
summary: A UL-classified neurological condition caused by forced separation from an attuned Focus. Causes progressive cognitive and perceptual impairments, with recovery requiring reattunement or specialized intervention. Designed as a narrative and mechanical stake for DM use.

## **Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome (SWS)**

_Neurological Condition | Classified UL Medical Phenomenon_

**Status:** Incurable without specialized intervention  
**Onset Trigger:** Forced or voluntary separation from an attuned Focus  
**Severity:** Progressive

---

### **Overview**

Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome occurs when a user who has been neurally synchronized with a Focus is separated from it. The brain, having adapted to continuous augmented perception and predictive assistance, struggles to function without the artificial layer it now treats as baseline reality.

United Laboratories officially classifies SWS as a _“cognitive dependency side effect.”_ Internally, it is referred to as **neural desynchronization trauma**.

Once attuned, the user **cannot voluntarily unattune** from the Focus without triggering SWS.

## **Mechanical Effects (D&D-Compatible)**

When a creature attuned to a Focus is separated from it for more than **10 minutes**, they begin suffering from Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome.

### **Stage I – Desynchronization (0–1 hour)**

- Disadvantage on **Wisdom (Perception)** checks
    
- Mild visual artifacts, phantom overlays, delayed reactions
    
- The character is aware that something is “missing,” even if they don’t know what
    

Narrative cues:  
Holograms that aren’t there. Targeting reticles that vanish mid-thought. A feeling of being suddenly blind in ways that don’t involve eyes.

---

### **Stage II – Cognitive Instability (1–8 hours)**

- Disadvantage on **Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws**
    
- Initiative rolls are made with **disadvantage**
    
- The character cannot benefit from advantage on Perception checks from any source
    

Narrative cues:  
Second-guessing decisions the Focus used to optimize. Overthinking trivial actions. Emotional irritability or unusual silence.

---

### **Stage III – Reality Fragmentation (8+ hours)**

- The character gains **one level of exhaustion** every 8 hours without the Focus
    
- Disadvantage on **all ability checks**
    
- At the start of each long rest, succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** or experience vivid hallucinations, false threat indicators, or phantom warnings (DM-controlled flavor, not forced actions)
    

Narrative cues:  
Seeing enemies where none exist. Expecting data that never arrives. Trusting instincts that used to be machine-verified—and now aren’t.

---

## **Recovery & Suppression**

- **Reattuning to the original Focus** immediately halts progression and removes all SWS effects after **1 hour**.
    
- Reattuning to a _different_ Focus requires:
    
    - A successful UL-approved resynchronization procedure
        
    - Or a risky black-market neural splice (story hook, consequences likely)
        

> Ordinary medical treatment, spells, or rest **cannot cure SWS**.

---

## **UL Official Position**

> “Simulacrum Withdrawal Syndrome is not a flaw.  
> It is evidence of successful neural integration.”

UL operatives are informed—often _after attunement_—that Focus deployment is intended to be **permanent**. Removal is considered a medical emergency, not a lifestyle choice.

---

## **Narrative Uses (DM Guidance)**

SWS exists to:

- Make the Focus feel **earned and costly**
    
- Create stakes when drones are destroyed or Focuses are stolen
    
- Encourage UL loyalty without mind control
    
- Add tension without stripping agency
    

Enemies who understand UL doctrine may:

- Target Focuses instead of killing operatives
    
- Use Focus theft as leverage
    
- Offer “freedom” at a very real neurological price

## **Tone Note**

This is not addiction.  
This is **adaptation**.

The brain learned a faster, clearer way to exist—and now resents being forced back into something smaller.
