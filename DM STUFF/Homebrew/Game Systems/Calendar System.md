## **Genesis Calendar System (GCS)**

**Origin:**  
The Genesis Calendar System (GCS) was created by United Laboratories (UL) following the creation of the Genesis Galaxy and the declaration of New Omega Aeternum as the galactic capital. The system serves as the official temporal framework for all UL operations, scientific research, and interstellar governance.

**Starting Point:**

- **0 P.G. (Post-Genesis):** Marks the creation of the Genesis Galaxy and the founding of New Omega Aeternum. All subsequent dates are counted from this point.

### **Time Units**

- **Cycle (Day):** 28 hours long. Each hour is 60 minutes, giving a total of 1,680 minutes per cycle.
    
- **Span (Week):** 7 cycles (196 hours / 11,760 minutes).
    
- **Arc (Month):** 40 cycles (1,120 hours / 67,200 minutes).
    
- **Orbit (Year):** 10 arcs, 400 cycles (11,200 hours / 672,000 minutes).
    
- **Era:** 500 orbits; represents a vast historical or galactic epoch.

### **Cycles of the Week (Spans)**

Each cycle within a span is given a unique UL-designated name:

1. **Virel** – Discovery and innovation
    
2. **Lumir** – Energy and light
    
3. **Aethon** – Motion and travel
    
4. **Xyra** – Knowledge and learning
    
5. **Kael** – Labor and production
    
6. **Noctis** – Rest, meditation, reflection
    
7. **Zephyra** – Renewal, nature, preparation

### **Arcs (Months)**

Each orbit contains 10 arcs, named for UL milestones, celestial phenomena, and exploration priorities:

1. **Genesis Arc** – Founding of New Omega Aeternum
    
2. **Lumina Arc** – Era of energy mastery
    
3. **Astra Arc** – Space exploration focus
    
4. **Quantis Arc** – Scientific and quantum breakthroughs
    
5. **Terra Arc** – Planetary development, terraforming, and colony growth
    
6. **Nexus Arc** – Diplomacy and interstellar contact
    
7. **Eclipse Arc** – Strategic review, shadow operations
    
8. **Aeon Arc** – Technological and artificial life advancements
    
9. **Aurora Arc** – Cultural and artistic expansion
    
10. **Omega Arc** – Consolidation, long-term planning, and archival focus

### **Time Formatting**

Dates are written as:

`[Year P.G.], Arc [number], Cycle [number] ([Cycle Name]), Hour [hh:mm]`

**Example:**

`3176 P.G., Arc 5, Cycle 12 (Aethon), Hour 14:37`

- This example marks a mid-season period in the **Terra Arc**, during peak planetary development and colony expansion.

**Summary:**  
The GCS is both a **functional timekeeping system** and a **cultural framework**, providing consistency across UL facilities, fleets, colonies, and research stations throughout the Genesis Galaxy. It ensures synchronization of scientific projects, political events, and interstellar logistics while also offering ceremonial and seasonal markers for cultural continuity.
